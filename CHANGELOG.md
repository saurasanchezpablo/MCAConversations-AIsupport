# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow SemVer.

Compatibility: Minecraft 1.21.1 · NeoForge 21.1.234+ · Java 21 · requires MCA Reborn
`[7.7.13,8)`. Architectury is not used. Optional: MCA: Quests, MCA: Reputation, MCA: Capitals 1.3+ (tested against 1.3.6), Serene Seasons, Townstead `[0.7.5,0.9)`, Ultima Kingdoms `[0.1,)`. As of 1.6.3, this release is built against the
compile-only API jars of MCA: Quests 1.6.4 and MCA: Reputation 0.6.0, vendored in `libs/api/` and hash-pinned by `gradle/sibling-apis.properties`; those jars are not packaged.

Entries up to and including 1.2.1 describe the Minecraft 1.20.1 / Forge line, which remains a
separate download and is not superseded by this one.

## [2.0.0-ai.1] - 2026-10-04

First release of **MCA: Conversations AI**, by Pablo Saura. It is based on upstream MCA: Conversations
1.8.0 by otectus. This edition replaces the original (same mod id), so install one or the other.

### Added
- **AI conversations** through MCA's chat-AI endpoint: free talk in your language, memory, and
  consequences within guardrails (hearts, moods, dispositions, promises, wishes, grudges, gossip,
  opinions of neighbours, directions, quests and discounts).
- **Talk on click**: right-click a villager to talk. Sneak + right-click opens MCA's menu.
- **An AI-only mode** and villagers who start conversations with you.
- **Spoken requests.**
  - Work: chop, mine, fish, hunt and harvest, with amounts and a progress bar. Villagers bring back
    what they gather.
  - Errands: guide, wait, pick up, store, fetch, breed, and cook or smelt at a furnace.
  - Building together from templates, with helpers.
  - Gifts chosen from your inventory, and tools lent when a villager needs one.
- **Words and deeds agree.**
  - Commitments run and refusals do not.
  - Impossible promises are rewritten before they are heard.
  - Interrupted tasks are announced.
  - Claims of having received something are checked.
  - Requests are read from your own words as a safety net.
- **A living village.**
  - Village events: festivals, markets, harvest feasts, funerals, weddings, births, welcomes,
    meetings after attacks, and elections.
  - Social life: villagers chat among themselves, quarrel, and accept mediation.
  - Personal life: dates, childhood memories, secrets and betrayal.
  - Practical life: real needs, threats and defence, skills and teaching.
- **The villager's bag.** Villagers react to what you take from or put into their inventory,
  depending on your relationship.
- **Presentation.** Bubbles over villagers' heads, an indicator of who you are talking to, and a
  `/diary` (`/diario`) in chat or as a written book.
- **Voiced lines** with acting direction (emotion, intent, delivery) in Spanish or English, through
  OpenAI or Gemini TTS. Set up with `/mcavoice`.
- **In-game GameTests** against a real MCA villager (`./gradlew runGameTestServer`).

### Changed
- Name, authorship, credits, version line (2.0.0-ai) and documentation for the AI edition.

## [1.8.0] - unreleased

Social behaviour, and Townstead. A villager meeting you for the first time now sounds like somebody
meeting you for the first time — no name they were never told, no friendship they never had — and
becoming friends takes being around rather than a pile of gifts. Hearts are still the one number you
see; what changed is what a villager may *assume* about you. And with Townstead installed, its
villagers' needs, shifts, trades, years, roots, buildings, village spirit and calendar become
something they talk about, act on and gossip about.

### Added — family integration pass (2026-09-27)

- **MCA: Crime integration** (`compat/CrimeBridge`, `compat/crime/`, compiled against Crime's vendored
  compile-only API jar and loaded by name after the presence check). Four dialogue conditions —
  `conversations_crime_wanted`, `conversations_crime_band` (`lawful`/`neutral`/`outlaw`),
  `conversations_crime_jailed`, `conversations_crime_heat` — that score 0 without Crime; four context
  fields (`crime.wanted`, `crime.band`, `crime.jailed`, `crime.speaker_is_law`) that read UNAVAILABLE
  without it; a witness memory (`mcaconversations.crime.saw.<crime>`, player-scoped) written on the
  villagers Crime names as witnesses; and a **guard voice**: Crime's challenge, stand-down, filed-report
  and accepted-apology lines are spoken in the guard's own personality through Crime's new
  `CrimeDialogueHooks`, with Crime's datapack line as the fallback. Gossip is deliberately not seeded
  here — with MCA: Reputation installed Crime's incidents already reach villagers as its gossip
  candidates, and a second telling in a second voice is the duplication §30.4 forbids. `enableCrime`
  switches all of it off; `CrimeIntegrationTest` keeps every Crime import inside `compat/crime/`.
- **Townstead `[0.7.5,0.9)`**, matching MCA: Quests. Forge enforces an optional range when the mod is
  present, so `[0.7.5,0.8)` would have refused to launch with Townstead 0.8 (the release that adds
  `api.v1`) even though the binding stubs every member it cannot resolve.
- The vendored sibling API jars are current: the 1.21.1 ports of MCA: Quests 1.7.1, MCA: Reputation 0.6.0 and MCA: Crime
  0.7.5, each hash-pinned in `gradle/sibling-apis.properties`.

### Fixed — family audit remediation (2026-09-28, mirrored from Forge)

- **MCA: Quests showed this mod's objective and reward as raw translation keys.** The `talk_about`
  objective and `unlock_topic` reward named keys whose text lived in MCA: Quests' lang file under the
  pre-0.4.0 `mcarealtalk` names, so the offer screen, journal and quest card printed the keys. The text
  now lives here, as `mcaconversations.quests.objective.talk_about` and
  `mcaconversations.quests.reward.unlock_topic` in `en_us` and `pt_br`, guarded by
  `QuestsCompatLangKeysTest`.
- **Radius-local chat pins its content where the work runs.** With `chatModeLocalChat` on, the content
  bundle was pinned on the network thread and the server-thread pipeline ran with none, so a `/reload`
  between two of its steps could answer one message from two catalogs. Both chat entry points now hand
  their work to one server-thread hop that pins inside it (`ChatModeDispatcherHopTest`).

### Fixed — audit (2026-09-30, mirrored from Forge)

The Forge line's 2026-09-30 audit (`AUDIT.md` in the Forge repository), carried over file for file;
release parity re-verified from both copies.

- **A villager kept standing still for a player who had walked away.** A hold from a chat exchange, a
  greeting or an initiative was renewed while its player was merely connected, so the villager stayed
  pinned and facing them for the whole attention window — thirty seconds by default, up to an hour as
  configured — after they had walked off, teleported or changed dimension. Those holds now drop the
  moment the player is out of chat reach (`chatModeAddressedRadius`, another level, dead), by the same
  rule that already refused their replies and dropped their queued lines.
- **An MCA: Quests `talk_about` objective counted clicks, not conversations.** The signal fired on every
  topic cooldown written, and a topic's "again" branch rewrites a cooldown that is still running, so
  clicking one topic three times finished "three heart-to-hearts". Only a cooldown written while none
  was running counts now.
- **A load that leaves the mod with no dialogue says so.** One malformed entry in any pack refuses the
  whole content load, and at server start there is nothing earlier to keep, so every topic this mod
  adds disappears until the pack is fixed and `/reload` is run. An ERROR now states that consequence and
  names the pack; the policy itself is unchanged and is an open decision.
- **Mixin targets that cannot be present are skipped before Mixin looks them up.** A mixin config plugin
  (`compat/MixinTargetPlugin`) answers "no" for a target the owning mod's jar does not contain — on
  this loader, Townstead's three dialogue-UI hooks on a client without Townstead — so that lookup no
  longer logs a `WARN Error loading class` that reads like a broken hook. Anything it cannot decide is
  applied exactly as before.
- **Typing pings are rate-limited on the server.** Each one runs an entity search; a client that sent
  more than its one a second was served every one. Pings are now acted on at most every five ticks.
- **`/conversations chat on|off|status` answers in the player's language.** The replies were English
  literals; they are now `commands.mcaconversations.chat.*` keys in `en_us` and `pt_br`.
- The client no longer quotes the previous server's discussion in its presence heartbeat after moving
  to another server; the handle is resynchronised with the connection before every use.
- The compatibility line above named Townstead `[0.7.5,0.8)`; `neoforge.mods.toml` has declared
  `[0.7.5,0.9)` since the 2026-09-27 pass.

### Changed

- **Strangers greet you like strangers.** The greeting a villager used for everyone who was not
  actively disliked called you by name and said things like "I was hoping I'd run into you" — to
  somebody they had never met. Greetings now follow the relationship: a neutral hello for someone
  they have never met, a plain "hello again" for someone they have, and a greeting of its own for a
  regular, a friend, a confidant, a spouse, a relative, somebody they have fallen out with and
  somebody who is against you. Toddlers get their own versions. Both locales.
- **Friendship needs time as well as hearts.** How close a villager treats you is now decided from
  hearts *and* from evidence that you know each other: separate days on which you actually talked,
  and the familiarity and trust the hidden disposition vector has built up. An acquaintance needs a
  little familiarity and two separate days, and no hearts at all; a friend needs sixty hearts and four
  days; a confidant eighty hearts, eight days and real trust. A generous gift to somebody you met once
  earns gratitude, not a confidant. Every threshold is a server setting under `[social]`.
- **A day counts only if something was said.** A contact day is credited when a villager actually
  answers something you chose to say, on either the dialogue screen or in chat, or accepts a gift from
  you — at most one a day, on a clock `/time set` cannot move. Opening the menu, picking a category,
  going back, being greeted, reading and the window's liveness pings count for nothing. Familiarity
  itself still moves only through the authored conversation deltas under the existing daily cap, so
  nothing is paid twice.
- **Family is family.** Being a villager's parent, child or sibling in MCA's family tree now makes
  you family, matched by UUID — the relationship band that was defined but could never be reached
  before. A relative, like a spouse, stays a relative in the middle of a quarrel: the band says how
  they speak to you right now, and the new `player.is_parent`, `player.is_child` and
  `player.is_sibling` fields, and `player.is_family`, keep saying who you are to them.
- **An unrepaired rupture now shows.** A rupture recorded between you and a villager makes them
  guarded whatever the heart total says, where before it was ignored when choosing the band.
- **Your old friends still know you.** In a world that existed before this mod kept track of your
  relationships in it — one upgraded from an earlier version, an MCA world that is only now adding
  Conversations, or one that ran with conversation history switched off — a villager who already had
  positive hearts with you, or is family, keeps treating you as they did. Whether a world counts is
  settled once, when its history file is first written: a world already a day old counts, a brand-new
  one does not. For each villager the decision is written once, at your first exchange, and nothing is
  invented to support it — no meeting, date or number of visits. Villagers you had never warmed to
  stay strangers, and `legacyRelationshipMigration` turns the import off.
- **Greetings follow the relationship, and a busy square is not a chorus.** Friends greet you as you
  pass far more often than strangers do; somebody you have hurt mostly lets you walk by. After one
  villager greets you, the others wait ten seconds (`ambientPlayerCooldownTicks`) before any of them
  may, on top of each villager's once-a-day limit. A greeting a villager volunteers no longer stops
  them in their tracks for half a minute: they carry on unless you answer.
- **Partners, family and respected strangers have their own greetings, in every personality's
  voice.** A spouse, a relative and — with MCA: Reputation — a stranger from a village that thinks
  well of you each get a greeting of their own, and every personality says it in character: the
  crabby spouse insists they were not waiting by the door, the greedy one calls you the best bargain
  they ever struck, the gloomy one admits they always half think you will not come back. Family
  greetings follow who is greeting whom: your child, whatever their age, greets you as a parent and
  never by your first name; a parent greets you as their grown child; a sibling as a sibling; and a
  toddler greets every relative alike. None of them assumes whether you are a man or a woman. The
  respected stranger's greeting is courtesy only: it never claims this villager saw what you did or
  knows your name, and a toddler still just peeks at you from behind a barrel. Both locales.
- **Regulars, friends, confidants and people you have fallen out with each have a greeting of their
  own, in every personality's voice.** Friends and confidants used to share one warm greeting, a
  regular got the same "hello again" as somebody met once, and a villager who was merely upset with
  you brushed you off exactly like one who wanted you gone. Now an acquaintance knows your name and
  treats you as a regular without claiming to have missed you — the anxious one has practised your
  name, the crabby one warns you not to make them regret learning it. A friend is simply glad to see
  you. A confidant drops the front: the confident villager admits, between the two of you, to being
  not half as sure of themselves as they look, and the peppy one asks to be not-bubbly for a minute.
  That greeting is said for you alone, so nobody nearby overhears it, and it is never romantic — your
  confidant may be married to somebody else. A villager you have quarrelled with is guarded rather
  than curt: careful, short and open to putting things right, with no wave and no use of your name,
  since a pair can be at odds without ever having been introduced. The curt greeting is kept for
  villagers who are hostile, and it no longer names you either. Toddlers have their own versions.
  Both locales. For resource-pack authors: the new pools are `chatmode.hail.acquaintance`,
  `chatmode.hail.friend`, `chatmode.hail.confidant` and `chatmode.hail.guarded`. `chatmode.hail`,
  which friends and confidants used to share, is no longer chosen for anybody and now holds only
  nameless lines; a pack that overrode it should move its lines to the pool they fit (`DATAPACK.md`).
- **A goodbye no longer contradicts the hello.** Everybody used to be seen off with the same friendly
  goodbye, so a villager who had just been guarded or cold with you would wave you off with "come back
  and tell me everything" — by name, even if they had never been told it. Somebody you have fallen out
  with now says a careful goodbye that promises nothing ("Right. We'll talk properly another time.
  Maybe."), somebody hostile is curt, and neither waves or uses your name. And your own children, of
  any age, no longer say goodbye to you by your first name: they see you off as a parent. Everybody
  else keeps the goodbye they had, and every personality voices the new ones in character — the greedy
  villager considers your account "paused", the odd one uninvites you from their dreams. Toddlers have
  their own. Both locales. The new pools are `chatmode.farewell.guarded`, `chatmode.farewell.hostile`
  and `chatmode.farewell.family.parent`.
- **Strangers, and people they have only met, greet in character.** The stranger and "hello again"
  greetings are now voiced by every personality family — the shy villager murmurs, the blunt one
  wants to know your business — without any of them claiming a friendship that is not there.
- **Nobody is addressed by a name they never gave.** MCA hands every line the player's name, but a
  villager who has never met you no longer uses it: goodbyes to strangers are nameless, and the
  Conversations hub's opening line, chat's small replies ("I'm not sure what you mean", "as you
  like", "I'll leave you be") and this mod's own additions to MCA's greeting lines no longer name you
  or claim an acquaintance, in any personality. Ask a stranger "how have you been?" and you get an
  honest answer from somebody who has not met you yet, rather than "you asked me that this
  morning". Both locales.
- **Opening the chat box turns a few heads, not the whole square.** Typing now draws a glance from
  at most the three nearest villagers, and never from one who is asleep or fleeing.
- **A villager who falls asleep ends the conversation.** A dialogue-screen discussion with a villager
  who goes to bed now closes, as `SPEAKER_UNAVAILABLE`, rather than waiting on somebody who is no
  longer there.
- **Switching chat mode off ends chat conversations cleanly.** A chat conversation that was live when
  a config reload switched chat mode off is now closed on the spot, with its own reason, instead of
  being left for its next reply to be refused. Conversations on the dialogue screen are untouched.

### Added

- **Topics you have finished with a villager stop being offered.** New server option
  `topics.hideExhaustedTopics` (default on). A topic counts as fully discussed between one player and
  one villager the first time the villager has answered a real reply inside it and the player then
  leaves through the dialogue — the leave answer or an answer back to the category. Leaving on the
  opening page, closing the screen, walking away or being brushed off by a guarded villager does not
  count. Other villagers still offer the topic and other players still get it from that villager. The
  record is kept in the progress ledger whether or not the option is on, so turning it on later hides
  what was finished earlier. Catalog rows and topic packs take a `repeatable: true` flag for topics
  that are never used up (check-ins, news, rumours, what they noticed, weather, season, the day,
  shared history, work offers, standing, and the Capitals and Townstead topics); when a category has
  nothing left the villager says so once and the page keeps its Back entry.

- Three context fields for dialogue and scenes: `social.contact` (`unmet` or `recognized`),
  `social.contact_days`, and `social.attitude` (`hostile`, `guarded`, `neutral`, `cordial`, `warm` or
  `affectionate`). Documented in `DATAPACK.md` under *Relationship bands*.
- A `[social]` section in the server config. Documented in `CONFIG.md`.
- A `social` block on scenes — `contact`, `attitudes`, `claims` (`prior_meeting`,
  `personal_friendship`, `romantic_relationship`, `family_tie`, `unresolved_rupture`,
  `shared_episode`) and `requires_known_player_name` — declares what a scene assumes about the pair
  and becomes hard eligibility: a scene whose assumptions do not hold is not a candidate at all. An
  unknown claim is refused rather than ignored, and the bundled content compiler refuses a line that
  names the player without declaring it. Documented in `DATAPACK.md`.
- `/conversations social inspect` (operators): the facts, roles, band, contact, attitude, greeting
  and farewell pools and thresholds the social model derived for the nearest villager and you.
- `/conversations social audit` (operators): the scenes other packs added without a `social` block,
  by pack. They load and play exactly as before — nothing is refused or hidden — but nothing checks
  what they assume about the player, and the list says where to add one. Each such pack is also noted
  in the reload diagnostics (`social_contract_absent`).

### Townstead

Townstead's needs, schedules, calendar, roots, professions, skills, buildings and village spirit are
now conversation state. Conversations only reads them: Townstead stays the authority on every one,
and without Townstead installed nothing below changes a line.

- **Five dialogue conditions.** `conversations_townstead_available` gates on a bound capability,
  `conversations_townstead` compares one allow-listed field (needs, schedule, life stage, profession,
  personality, calendar, building, origin, spirit) with a typed operator, and
  `conversations_townstead_tags`, `conversations_townstead_spirit` and `conversations_townstead_skill`
  read Townstead's own context tags, village spirit and learned skills. They are registered on every
  install, so a pack using them loads without Townstead; there each one is simply false, and a
  malformed one is refused rather than read as true.
- **A `townstead_fit` check term.** A dialogue check may name Townstead tags that help or hinder it —
  a well-fed villager hears a request more kindly, an exhausted one less. The term is clamped to
  `maxCheckFit` and is exactly zero without Townstead, so no existing check moves.
- **Eighteen `townstead.*` context fields and twenty-three `%townstead_*%` template values** — the
  need to speak about first, the current activity, life stage, trade level, building, species, village
  spirit, month and weekday among them — each with a neutral fallback line in both locales.
- **One calendar, not two.** `calendarSource` now decides who says what season it is: in `AUTO`,
  Townstead's calendar when it names a season, then Serene Seasons, then the built-in cycle. Festivals
  on a Townstead calendar come from a new reloadable `townstead_holidays` mapping, shipped for
  Townstead's four calendar profiles. A day no mapping names is no festival at all, rather than the
  old fixed cycle laid over an unrelated calendar, unless `useLegacyHolidayFallbackWithTownstead` is
  set.
- **Custom personalities keep their names.** An interiority profile for a namespaced personality is
  no longer collapsed onto its bare path, so two packs' `reserved_scholar` are two profiles. A
  Townstead custom personality uses its own profile when a pack authored one, then the profile of the
  MCA personality it is based on.
- **Villagers react to how a conversation went.** A reply that lands, amuses, helps, stings, is
  refused or goes awkwardly can now play one of thirteen heart-neutral Townstead reactions — a wave
  on greeting and farewell, a clap, a pointed finger, a facepalm, tears. Content may name one with
  the new `conversations_townstead_react` action; otherwise the reply's check tier, outcome and stance
  choose, and an ordinary accepted line plays nothing. Each reply settles once, after all of its
  actions have run, and plays at most one reaction, whatever order the actions were written in.
  Reactions need Emotecraft, which is the only animation backend Townstead has; without it nothing
  plays and nothing else changes.
- **Townstead sees the hearts you actually got.** After a conversation changes hearts, Townstead is
  told the measured change — what MCA really applied, including a sensitive villager's doubled
  loss — so its `heart_increased` and `heart_decreased` tags are true.
- **Chat counts as a conversation.** A typed-chat conversation now opens and closes Townstead's
  dialogue state the way its own dialogue screen does, and closes it on farewell, mute, a new
  partner, logout, the conversation ending, or the chat window lapsing.
- **A villager's day shapes chat.** Someone asleep, collapsed, in a need emergency, in danger or in
  another player's conversation no longer greets you as you pass, and the day's greeting is kept for
  later rather than spent. Ask a villager at work, or worn out, in chat for a long or personal
  conversation and they say they are in the middle of something instead of starting it; small talk still works,
  and a collapsed villager manages nothing more. Collapsed and mid-reaction villagers do not answer a
  remark to the crowd, at most one villager at work does, and chat attention never stops a villager
  Townstead is animating, and only turns one at work to face you rather than stopping them. All of it
  follows `scheduleRespectEnabled`.
- **A gift that helped is known to have helped.** A tick after a gift is accepted, the villager's
  needs are read again; only if Townstead's own hunger, thirst or fatigue improved does the villager
  remember it (`mcaconversations.gift.relieved_hunger`, `relieved_thirst`, `helped_recovery`, for a
  quarter of a day) and look grateful. Conversations never fills a need, and a helpful gift earns no
  extra heart.
- **The village talks about its own.** The gossip sweep now notices ten kinds of Townstead news: a
  neighbour in a real hunger, thirst or exhaustion emergency, a collapse, a recovery from either, a
  step up in a trade, a newly learned skill, a new stage of life, a birthday, a building finished or
  gone, and the village's spirit changing character. Every one has lines in all five gossip voices
  (ordinary, discreet, teenage, childish and close-neighbour) in both locales. It is kept quiet on
  purpose: the first sight of anybody or anything says nothing, a crisis is news once and stays a
  crisis until every need is comfortable again, the same villager's next crisis waits
  `needCrisisCooldownDays`, a recovery is news only after a crisis was, a building is gone only once
  `buildingRemovalConfirmScans` sweeps agree, and a villager who could not be read has not changed.
  Nobody gossips about fertility, genes, heritage or a need's actual numbers. Buildings and spirits
  are named in the listener's language through Townstead's and MCA's own translations.
- **"Life here".** With Townstead running, the conversation hub gains a *Life here* category of
  eight topics — how a villager is keeping, how their days run, their trade, the years, their
  people, the places they call home, what the village is becoming, and the calendar — each with an
  always-available opener and scenes that answer to Townstead's own state: somebody running on an
  empty stomach, somebody so tired the ground looks soft, somebody mid-shift, a trade level named in
  Townstead's words, the building they are standing in, the village's spirit, today's date, a
  festival. All eight can be typed in chat as well as clicked, in both locales, and each has a
  personality voice for its opening lines. Without Townstead the category and its topics are not
  offered at all.
- **Townstead in familiar conversations too.** *How's your day* knows when a villager is mid-shift,
  *the season* can go by Townstead's calendar, and *life* has something to say from the later years.
- **Emotion in Townstead's dialogue screen.** Some of these lines carry Townstead's typewriter
  effects — a sleepy drawl, a whisper, a flash of temper — inside Townstead's own dialogue screen
  only. The tags live in a separate client file (`assets/mcaconversations/townstead_emotions/`), so
  chat mode, system chat, text-to-speech and MCA's screen still show clean text; Townstead's own
  tags always win; and with Townstead absent or changed, the screen simply shows the plain line.
- **Diagnostics.** `/conversations compat townstead status` for anyone; `probe`, `snapshot` and
  `explain <question> <answer>` for operators, and `snapshot genes` at level 3 for heritage and
  inheritance detail; `/conversations compat namespace` names the MCA package root this build bound.

### Compatibility

- Saves: each pair gains an optional `contact` record, written only after its first credited
  exchange, and the history store gains one flag marking whether the world predates the social model.
  The history schema is still 1, so this build and 1.7.x read each other's files. A 1.7.x build
  ignores the new keys, and drops them if it saves the world; opened again under 1.8.0, such a world
  is treated as an upgraded one and each pair's contact record starts over. Network protocol
  unchanged at 4.
- Content gated on `conversations_relationship` sees the new bands. In an upgraded world the
  heart-based bands are preserved for existing relationships; new ones have to be lived.
- Interiority: a profile authored under a namespace other than `mca` or `minecraft` (for example
  `mypack:odd`) used to replace the bare `odd` profile, and now defines a profile of its own. A
  profile id that is not a valid personality id is refused with the rest of the reload.
- A new datapack directory, `townstead_holidays`, is staged with the rest of the content bundle: a
  malformed mapping refuses the reload like any other section.
- Gossip saves: the gossip file gains a format number, a `townstead` section of plain observed
  values, and optional bounded attributes on an event. A pre-1.8.0 gossip file loads as before. A
  1.7.x build skips the new event types, ignores the rest, and drops them if it saves the world.
  Removing Townstead leaves the section untouched, so re-adding it carries on where it stopped.
- Catalog topics accept a strict boolean `townstead`; a topic carrying it is offered only while
  Townstead's content is live. The `village` chat intent no longer answers questions about a
  village's *spirit*, which now belong to *Life here*.
- The MCA binding gains two members, `Village.getBuildings` and `Building.getId`, present in every
  supported MCA version (checked against 7.6.20, 7.7.0-beta.2 and 7.7.1-alpha.2).
- **Both loaders ship 1.8.0 together.** The Forge 1.20.1 build carries the same Townstead and
  social behaviour and content; this port's only differences from it are recorded, with reasons,
  in `tools/parity/parity-1.8.0-adaptations.json`. Players need the 1.8.0 jar too, whatever the
  protocol allows: the new lines are in its client-side language files.

## [1.7.3] - unreleased

Ultima Kingdoms support. Villages now belong to kingdoms and guilds have villagers who speak for
them, and a topic can be offered only where that is true. This release is about those restrictions
holding on every way into a conversation, and failing closed when Ultima cannot answer.

A build of this code was distributed inside Ultima Kingdoms' own integration packs under the version
number 1.7.2. It is the same source as this release apart from the three fixes listed under *Fixed*;
replace that jar with this one. The network protocol is unchanged at 4, so a 1.7.1 or 1.7.2 client
still pairs with a 1.7.3 server.

Ultima Kingdoms has no NeoForge 1.21.1 release yet. This port carries the same reflective bridge and
the same content so the two loaders stay one deliverable; until Ultima ships here the bridge stays
inert, `guild_contact` never appears, and every kingdom-gated topic stays hidden unless its gate
explicitly allows an unknown answer.

### Added

- **A topic can belong to a kingdom.** A catalog row or topic pack may carry a `kingdom_gate`: which
  kingdoms, judged by whose residence or origin, and optionally how the player stands with that
  kingdom's faction. The topic is then hidden wherever the gate fails, before it is ever offered — in
  the dialogue screen, a direct submission, a numbered reply, typed chat and the dynamic hub alike.
  The same gate is available one level down as the `conversations_kingdom` result condition, so a
  topic everybody can open can still have a villager born in one kingdom talk about home differently
  from their neighbours. The gate's shape is published as a JSON schema at
  `assets/mcaconversations/schemas/kingdom_gate.schema.json`, and an unknown key or a malformed id is
  refused at reload rather than quietly read as "no restriction".
- **Guild contacts.** A villager Ultima has appointed to speak for a guild can now be asked about it.
  The new `guild_contact` topic (Village category, adults only) explains what the guild can do for
  you and, if you qualify, puts in a request for an introduction to another chapter or for the
  guild's commissions. Ultima decides whether you qualify and where an introduction leads; the
  villager only relays its answer, to you alone, and never learns or repeats the destination. Asking
  moves no hearts, no disposition and no opinion: being qualified by an institution is not the same as
  being liked by the person at the counter.
- **For pack authors:** `civic_contact` on a topic, the `conversations_civic` action (and
  `civic_action` on a topic-pack reply, which compiles to it), eleven `civic.*` context fields and the
  `civic_organization` template variable. All of it is documented in `DATAPACK.md` under *Kingdom
  gates and civic contacts*.

### Changed

- **One gate for every way into a topic.** The catalog's age allow-list, the kingdom gate and the
  civic-contact requirement are now decided by a single `TopicGate`, and every entry path asks it —
  including the dynamic hub, which used to check age on its own.
- **A starter on somebody else's question is protected too.** A dialogue-screen submission is now
  routed through this mod's one-shot executor whenever its question and answer are a catalog starter,
  not only when the question is one of this mod's own. A topic a pack merges into MCA's `greet`, or
  into a category page of its own, can no longer be submitted past its gates by a crafted packet.
- **A gate that cannot be evaluated hides what it guards.** If the answer-list filter fails, every
  starter carrying a kingdom or civic restriction is removed from the menu; age-only and unrestricted
  answers are left as MCA offered them, as before. A kingdom gate whose Ultima call fails is a closed
  gate, whatever its `when_unknown` says.
- **"Unavailable" and "zero standing" are no longer the same answer.** The Reputation bridge can now
  report that a local standing could not be resolved at all, which a faction-standing gate needs in
  order not to treat an unknown community as a neutral one.
- A topic's opening line now receives the template variables its `funnel.open.vars_used` declares,
  which the generated guild-contact openers rely on for the guild's name.

### Fixed

- **A typo in `civic_contact` no longer opens a civic topic to everybody.** The flag was read leniently,
  so `1`, `"yes"` or any other non-boolean value became `false` — an ungated topic. Anything but a JSON
  `true` or `false` is now refused, at generation and at reload.
- **The answer-list filter can no longer throw into MCA.** Its recovery path read the catalog again
  unguarded; a second failure there would have escaped into MCA's own answer listing. It is now
  contained and logged once.
- **A guild request that never reaches Ultima says so in words.** With Ultima Kingdoms absent the
  reply used a translation key only Ultima ships, so a player would have seen the raw key. It now uses
  `mcaconversations.civic.unavailable`, in both locales.

## [1.7.2] - unreleased

MCA: Reputation 0.6.0 adoption. A village can now say what a player is *known for*, separately from
how much it likes them — and this release is about villagers only ever drawing on the part of that
they personally heard.

### Added

- **Villagers can remark on what they know you for.** With MCA: Reputation 0.6.0 installed, a
  villager who has actually heard about something you did can raise it: the one who was told you
  stood your ground says so, and the one who was told somebody got hurt says that instead, to your
  face rather than behind your back. Both lines are filtered through what *that villager* knows, so a
  resident who has heard nothing says nothing, and neither line is warmth: being widely known is not
  being liked, and hearts, familiarity and who is willing to marry you are untouched by any of it.
- **A new dialogue condition, `conversations_reputation_profile`.** Packs can ask what the village as
  a whole can say about a player (`"scope": "community"`) or what one villager knows
  (`"scope": "speaker"`, the default): a recognition floor or ceiling, a recognition tier, and up to
  sixteen facet clauses with their own evidence requirements. Every clause is ANDed, an unknown facet
  id fails closed, a facet with no evidence behind it does not satisfy a "not violent" gate by
  accident, and a question nobody can answer scores zero so the pack's own fallback branch runs — it
  never quietly becomes the village's answer to a villager's question. Registered with or without
  MCA: Reputation installed, like its two siblings. See `DATAPACK.md`.
- **Three context fields for the same facts**, usable from `conversations_context` and from scene
  conditions: `standing.speaker_knows_player`, `standing.speaker_recognition_tier` and
  `standing.speaker_known_for`. All three read unavailable without MCA: Reputation or without its
  profile layer, so a profile-gated scene hides itself rather than firing on a false.

### Changed

- **An apology is paid for once, however many people you say it to.** The identity a conversation
  deed was recorded under named the villager standing in front of you, so the same apology could be
  repeated to a different resident for a fresh reward — while a second, unrelated grievance could not
  be apologised for at all, because the menu decision alone was the whole identity. A conversation
  deed is now delivered under an operation identity that names the decision and the exact incident it
  answers: one apology per grievance, every other grievance still addressable, and a replay after a
  reconnect or a reopened screen recovers the first answer instead of paying again. A decision that
  amends an earlier one now supersedes its predecessor rather than stacking on it, and an apology for
  something this villager has never heard of records nothing at all.
- **The villager is a real witness and a real speaker.** A deed the villager was present for is
  recorded with them as a witness, and the incident it answers is selected through their own
  knowledge rather than from the village's ledger, so nothing a resident has not heard about can be
  apologised for or reported to them.
- **One standing term in a check, still, and now the facet-aware one.** Where MCA: Reputation can
  answer per villager, that answer already carries their reading of what you are known for, so it
  replaces the village-level term rather than adding to it — the ±8 ceiling on public standing in a
  TRUST or RESPECT check is unchanged, and a check still cannot be carried by standing alone.
- **Optional operations are negotiated, not guessed.** The integration asked MCA: Reputation once,
  reflectively, whether it had one method; it now reads that mod's own capability report, so nine
  optional operations are used when they exist and fall back cleanly when they do not. A build too old
  to report its capabilities keeps the village-level behaviour it always had.
- **A resolved or corrected story is not retold in its old form.** A deed a later one absorbed, or one
  the village decided did not happen, is no longer offered as village talk.
- Vendored MCA: Reputation API jar refreshed to the NeoForge 1.21.1 build of 0.6.0
  (`libs/api/mcareputation-0.6.0-api.jar`, hash-pinned in `gradle/sibling-apis.properties`). The API
  version it declares is still 2 — the NeoForge generation of that API — so this build's handshake
  with it is unchanged, and MCA: Reputation remains entirely optional.

## [1.7.1] - unreleased

Conversation stability. A dialogue that ends because the player walked away must end on the client
too: the explanation belongs to the conversation that produced it, and nothing it leaves behind may
follow the player to the next villager.

### Fixed

- **An explanation from one villager no longer takes over the next villager's screen.** Walking out
  of range mid-answer clears the offer and leaves a short explanation in its place, deliberately, so
  the card does not vanish under the cursor with nothing said. That shell has no offer attached, and
  the screen's teardown only looked for a live offer, so closing the window left the sentence behind
  on the client — and the ownership gate that decides who draws the dialogue never asked which
  villager it belonged to. The next villager the player spoke to inherited it and showed the stale
  explanation instead of their own dialogue, with MCA's own menu suppressed underneath. Offers and
  the explanations they leave now name the villager whose screen received them; an interaction screen
  shows only what its own villager owns, and closing one retires the offer and the explanation
  together while leaving a chat conversation untouched. A screen that is replaced rather than closed
  — MCA's family tree button does exactly that — is reconciled against the window, and a newly opened
  screen inherits nothing from the one before it.

### Added

- **Every conversation now has a name, and every message says which one it belongs to.** Until now a
  payload could only say "this player's current conversation", which is why a click from a window that
  had just closed was answered against whoever the player had turned to next. The server now tells the
  client which discussion it has accepted, and every answer, topic return, close and liveness ping
  quotes that name back. Anything naming a conversation that has ended — a click, a close, a ping, an
  explanation — is refused and nothing else: the exchange the player is actually in keeps its card,
  its villager and its place. Refusals stay refusals, too; a duplicated or late answer never closes a
  conversation that is working.
- **You can walk while you talk: sixteen blocks, with a second's grace out to twenty-four.** A
  graphical conversation used to be governed by a fixed eight blocks that nothing could change and
  nobody was told about — a step too far and the next answer simply failed, with the window still
  open as if nothing had happened. The distance a conversation may be *continued* at is now sixteen
  blocks and configurable, standing exactly that far apart counts as in range, and between sixteen
  and twenty-four there is a second in which the card stays readable and a step back inside picks
  the conversation up where it was. Nothing may be *done* from out there — an answer or a topic
  change is refused until you are back in range — and past twenty-four blocks the conversation ends
  at once. Opening a conversation is untouched: it still takes an ordinary interaction at MCA's own
  reach, so none of this lets anybody start talking from across the square. Chat mode keeps its own
  hearing radii, which are a different question and were left alone.
- **A window that vanishes gives the villager back.** A graphical conversation deliberately has no
  reading timeout, which left the server no way to tell a player reading a long reply from a client
  that had crashed — and a villager could stand attending nobody indefinitely. The open window now
  reports itself on a quiet cadence, and a discussion that stops reporting is closed and its villager
  released within five seconds. Nothing waits for the client to agree: a crashed or malfunctioning
  one cannot keep an NPC pinned by declining to acknowledge the ending.
- **Villagers now stay put and look at you for the whole discussion.** An accepted conversation
  stops the villager's own walking — wandering, following, setting off for work, crossing the village
  on their schedule — and turns them to face whoever they are talking to, for as long as the
  conversation lasts: reading for several minutes, changing topic, opening the history drawer, none
  of it loses them. MCA's own walk-toward-you step is cancelled at its source rather than undone
  afterwards, which is what a villager who drifted away mid-sentence was winning against before.
  Staying put means exactly that and nothing more: the villager is not invulnerable, still falls,
  still takes knockback, and is never teleported back to where they were standing — anything that
  actually shoves them out of range simply ends the conversation the ordinary way. Ending the
  discussion hands them straight back to their own schedule, and returning to the topic list is not
  ending it. `holdVillagerDuringInteraction` turns the standing still off and keeps the facing.

- **Another player can take the conversation over, and the villager simply turns to them.** A
  villager has one person they are talking to, and until now a second player walking up argued with
  the first one's conversation instead of replacing it. An accepted interaction from somebody else
  now hands the villager over in a single step on the server: they keep standing exactly where they
  are — there is no moment in between in which they are free to walk off — and turn to face whoever
  just spoke to them. The first player's window closes saying the villager is speaking with someone
  else, and their card, their pending reply and anything their conversation had queued go with it.
  The second player starts a conversation of their own and inherits nothing: no thread, no choices,
  no history belonging to the first. Nor can the first player's client reach the new conversation
  afterwards — a late close, a liveness ping, a click on the card that has already gone, even MCA's
  own close arriving on their connection, all refused, with the villager still held by the person
  actually talking to them. A villager who has just been attacked can be taken over by nobody until
  the delay has run, and repeated opens of the same villager by the same player are limited, so a
  stuck right-click cannot flicker a villager between owners several times a second. Bystanders and
  group dialogue are unchanged: neither of them is an owner.

### Changed

- **An attack ends the conversation, and the conversation cannot come back.** Being hit used to
  pause the hold for as long as the villager flinched and then take them prisoner again the moment
  the flinch ended — which is how a villager who should have been running from a zombie stood in
  place to finish a sentence. Any blow now ends the discussion outright: the window closes, the
  pending reply is dropped, the villager is released the same instant, and there is nothing left
  anywhere that could resume. A hit that armour or a shield absorbs counts, a hit from anything at
  all counts — the zombie behind the villager is the case that matters most — and one blow ends the
  conversation once however many ways the game reports it. A villager already fleeing is released the
  same way (`interruptOnImmediateDanger`), and none of it is a snub: no hearts move, and MCA's own
  crime and reputation handling stays the only thing that decides what attacking a villager means.
  This no longer depends on the conversation-states feature being switched on, because being free to
  run away is not a feature.
- **After an attack, that villager will not talk again for five seconds.** Long enough that the
  player who just swung cannot immediately pin the villager they hit, short enough that a genuine
  apology is only a moment away; `attackReopenDelayTicks` sets it, and continuing danger keeps
  refusing regardless. The delay belongs to the villager, so a bystander cannot pin them either.
- **A guard who is attacked mid-conversation still fights back.** `attackedBehavior` defaults to
  `NATIVE_COMBAT`: the conversation ends and MCA's own reaction is left completely alone, profession
  and all. Servers that would rather see every villager break away first can set `RETREAT`, which
  drops any attack target the villager had just acquired and puts them straight into their panic
  behaviour instead.
- **Turning chat mode off no longer lets villagers walk away from their dialogue window.** Chat
  mode's own engagements and the glances of somebody typing nearby end with it, as they should; a
  graphical conversation never had anything to do with chat mode and now keeps its villager on a
  server that runs with it disabled.
- **Ending a discussion now ends MCA's side of it too.** MCA used to be left believing a window was
  still open on a villager this mod had already released, which blocked its own interaction handling
  until something else noticed. The teardown now closes MCA's interaction as well — but only while
  that interaction still belongs to the player whose discussion ended, so it can never shut a window
  somebody else is reading.
- **The choice channel is now protocol 4, and 1.7.1 does not pair with 1.7.0.** The registrar is
  versioned with an exact match, so a 1.7.0 client is refused by a 1.7.1 server and vice versa —
  deliberately, and with a clear rejection rather than a misread payload. Update both sides together;
  on a dedicated server that means the server jar and every player's jar, and both loaders' builds
  publish together.
- **The server, not the screen, now decides which villager a dialogue belongs to.** A graphical offer
  used to be recorded against no villager at all, leaving the client to infer one from whichever
  window happened to be open. The villager now comes from MCA's own record of who is interacting with
  whom, at the moment MCA accepts the interaction, so an offer names a real speaker before it is ever
  sent. Closing the window tells the server so directly, instead of the ending having to be inferred
  a few seconds later.
- **Closing your window can no longer end somebody else's conversation.** MCA's own close request
  names a villager and nothing more, and acts on it without checking who sent it — so after a villager
  changed hands, the previous player's window closing took the villager away from the player who was
  mid-sentence with them. That close is now refused when it comes from someone who is not the
  villager's current partner, and left completely untouched for any villager this mod is not managing.
- **A conversation's queued lines now end with that conversation, and only that one.** Deferred
  villager replies were cancelled per player, so an ending swept up anything the player's *next*
  exchange had already queued. Each queued line is stamped with the conversation that produced it.
- **A conversation that ends can no longer hand back a villager somebody else is talking to.** Ending
  a discussion released the villager by name alone, so on a shared server the tail end of one
  player's conversation — a delayed close, a timeout swept a moment late, a logout — freed a villager
  who had already turned to somebody else, and that second player's partner wandered off
  mid-sentence. Each accepted discussion is now identified in its own right, the server records who
  is talking to whom on both sides of the pair, and a villager is released only by the discussion
  that actually held them. The same identity makes an ending arriving late harmless: a close for a
  conversation that has already been replaced — including one between the same player and the same
  villager, reopened — is ignored instead of tearing down the conversation that replaced it.
- **A conversation that fails to end tidily still ends.** Teardown now runs as ordered, independently
  guarded steps, so a step that fails cannot leave the ones after it unrun; whatever else goes wrong,
  the villager is handed back and the pair can start again immediately. Ending a topic is still not
  ending the conversation: returning to the topic list leaves the player standing there with the
  villager still attending, exactly as before. Each ending also carries a permanent identifier rather
  than its position in a list, so the reason a conversation closed survives future versions, and six
  new ones name endings the server could previously only describe as something vaguer: the screen was
  closed, the player turned to another villager, another player took over, the villager was attacked,
  the villager left the loaded world, or the villager had to flee immediate danger. None of them
  carries any social meaning — a technical ending is still never a snub.
- **Reading for several minutes no longer loses you the villager.** The idle sweep protected a
  conversation only while an unanswered card was on screen, so a player between topics, or reading
  the history drawer, could have the conversation swept out from under them for the crime of not
  clicking anything. While the window is open and reporting itself, the sweep leaves that discussion
  alone entirely; it ends when the conversation ends, and not on a stopwatch.
- **A conversation the server ends now closes the window it was being read in.** Until now the
  terminal message retired the card and left the empty shell standing, so the only way out of a
  conversation that was already over was to close it by hand. The matching window now closes itself,
  saying why where a refused answer would have said why it lapsed — too far apart, or the villager
  cannot carry on — and only ever the window belonging to the discussion that ended. It sends the
  server no close of its own for an ending the server is the one that announced.
- **Eight new server settings for how long a discussion lasts.** In the server file under
  `[conversation]`: `continueDistance` (16.0) and `immediateCloseDistance` (24.0) with
  `distanceGraceTicks` (20) between them, `guiLeaseTicks` (100) for how long an open window may go
  without reporting itself, `holdVillagerDuringInteraction` (true), and the safety trio
  `attackReopenDelayTicks` (100), `attackedBehavior` (`NATIVE_COMBAT`, with `RETREAT` as the
  alternative for servers that would rather a guard broke off) and `interruptOnImmediateDanger`
  (true). Every one of them is documented in CONFIG.md; the cadence the window reports itself on
  stays an internal constant, because the lease is the number that decides anything.

## [1.7.0] - unreleased

Refinement release: all ten stages of the refinement plan, shipped as one version.
Stable dialogue geometry with keyboard reading and held-confirmation arming; named choice outcomes
with one teardown path and client-free packets; the restrained card as the default presentation; a
documented reload transaction boundary with probe fixtures; continuity-aware scene admission; the
delivered history drawer, the presentation pane and plain-language availability sentences;
identity-neutral authored voice; one reload, one published bundle; safe continuation through existing
threads; and a bounded follow-through content slice, eight encounters in four topic packs and one
profession pack, in both locales, in place of the deferred large expansion. The network protocol moves
to 3 and the recommended presentation defaults change for new installs; stored settings are kept.

### Changed

- **Both loaders share the 1.7.0 behavior and content.** The NeoForge parity pass also carries
  terminal-reply menu recovery, bystander eligibility and accepted-only single-item gift tracking
  into both versions. See `docs/PARITY-1.7.0.md` for the complete validation record.
- **History and presentation replace the response list while open.** The renderer previously drew
  answers and number badges beneath the translucent utility surface, leaving both sets of text
  visible. Only the active document is now drawn in the response viewport; closing the utility
  restores the answers without moving the card or the villager's line.
- **Coming back to a subject lands where its author said it should.** A thread template has always
  declared the scenes a subject may be picked up in, and nothing read them: continuing depended on a
  scene that happened to open the same thread, which meant the line written for returning after four
  days was often not a candidate at all. The scenes a pair's own threads name are now evaluated
  first, under the same gates, the same slot binding, the same recency suppression and the same work
  bounds as everything else — an ordering, not a weight, and not an exemption. Nothing replays the
  starter the player already answered, and nothing restores a response index: the resume scene is
  where the conversation resumes.
- **A continuation that cannot be established is declined, not improvised.** Before the villager
  offers to continue anything, the thread is revalidated against the content actually loaded: the
  template still exists, still describes the same subject under the same topic, still names a scene
  the catalog holds, and its retained episode is unexpired and in a state that scene accepts. Cooldown, lapsing and the resume
  budget are checked with it. Any of those failing means the subject is simply not raised — no
  invented middle, no assumed check result, no follow-up fact the villager was never in a position
  to observe. The same rule removes a menu entry that would have opened nothing.
- **The continuation label says less.** The entry now reads as "about what we were discussing", with
  the domain named only where the hub already allows it and the personal entry naming nothing at all.
  A villager has no way of knowing whether the player left four days ago or was interrupted
  mid-sentence, so the button no longer implies one; the authored scene says what was going on. Both
  locales are updated, and the phrases chat mode matches follow the new wording.
- **One reload publishes one body of content, or none of it.** Eleven datapack listeners each
  published their own section the moment they had one, so a pack with a typo in it left the beats at
  their old contents, the topics partially replaced, and the content generation advanced over the
  top of both. A reload is now staged whole, cross-validated, and published as a single bundle with
  a single generation. A rejected reload changes nothing: the previous topics, beats, scenes,
  intents, professions, interiority, identity tokens, culture and narrative templates all stay in
  force together, and so do the executable questions MCA parsed for them, so an answer card a player
  is still looking at can still be answered. A malformed entry is a refusal rather than a silent
  drop, because dropping it was how a working catalog got replaced by half of one.
- **A reload diagnostic names the resource that caused it.** Every problem carries the attempt, the
  generation it was aiming at, the listener, the directory, the resource, the pack it came from, a
  JSON pointer to the offending member, and the line and column when the failure was a syntax error.
  Fields that genuinely are not knowable are recorded as unknown rather than guessed. Each reload
  ends with one summary naming the verdict, the previous and published generations, how many
  executable questions were retained, and whether the retention hook was observed at all. A single
  bad resource is reported once, not once per reference derived from it.
- **A refused answer says which thing went wrong.** Every rejection used to clear the card as
  "expired", whatever had happened. A reply is now refused as content reloaded, speaker unavailable,
  out of range, requirements changed, or execution failed, and the card leaves the sentence on
  screen with one safe action — back to topics where that is still viable, otherwise close.
- **A failed action is never reported as a success.** The consumed signal used to be sent from a
  `finally` block, so an answer whose action threw, and an answer MCA's engine declined to run, both
  told the client they had worked. Execution now reports its own result on both frontends: an offer
  is claimed exactly once before anything runs, a thrown or refused action ends the exchange through
  the single teardown path as a contained error, and any follow-up card that a half-completed action
  managed to schedule is cleared with it. Nothing is retried, replayed or assumed rolled back.
- **A stale packet can no longer dismiss a live decision.** A rejection is matched to the offer it
  answers, so a delayed refusal of an old card leaves a newer one standing, and a decision replaced
  unanswered is reported as superseded rather than as consumed.
- **Villagers stop broadcasting lines nobody classified.** An utterance's audience is decided before
  it is scheduled, from that utterance and that speaker. Recorded confidences, personal disclosures,
  sensitive static lines, and anything whose privacy is simply unknown are said to the player they
  were said to; only lines classified as safe to overhear reach bystanders, and a second speaker's
  line is never judged by another turn's metadata.
- **The choice packets no longer name client code.** Both server-to-client choice packets handed
  their payload to a client class directly. Decoding and channel registration stay common, and the
  physical client installs the handler during client setup, so a dedicated server never has the
  class in reach. The clear packet also carries stable result identifiers instead of enum ordinals,
  and an identifier a build does not recognise clears silently rather than dropping the connection.
  The channel protocol moves to 3, declared in `gradle.properties` like every other version string.

- **The response card stops moving between turns.** The panel, the question region, the response
  viewport and the footer are now computed from the window, the GUI scale, the font and the style
  alone. They no longer follow the number of answers, the length of the question, the current page or
  the offer revision, so an answer does not slide out from under the pointer when the villager says
  something shorter, and paging no longer resizes the card. The frame is recomputed only when the
  window, the GUI scale, the font, the resource pack, the language or the style changes.
- **Every response is laid out in full.** The card reserves the response space for the whole offer
  and shows each answer at its natural height inside one scrolling viewport; nothing shrinks the
  font, shortens authored text or drops an answer. Pages are still packed to fit, and an answer taller
  than the whole viewport scrolls inside it instead of being cut. The previous per-row scrollbar is
  gone: there is one response scroll, so a long answer can be read without holding the pointer on it.
- **The question has its own reading region.** A question longer than its region scrolls inside a
  clipped area with its own scrollbar. The wheel belongs to whichever region it is over, including at
  the top and bottom of that region: scrolling the question can no longer turn the answer page, and
  neither can a wheel event the card does not otherwise use.

- **The villager's own voice no longer assumes a gender.** The outlaw pack described itself as "a
  woman doing sums at her own table" and thanked the player with the feminine "Obrigada", while its
  applicability names only the profession and adult age. Those lines, the "woman who mends carts"
  pair, a "says she has changed" self-reference and the plural-capable watcher slot lines were
  rewritten identity-neutrally in both locales without flattening the character; the same class of
  line was repaired in the mercenary, armorer, weaponsmith and werewolf-expert packs. Repairs live in
  `src/content/` and the generated resources were regenerated. The remaining corpus-wide Portuguese
  first-person agreement (`Obrigada/Obrigado`, `cansada`, `pronta`, ...) is recorded in the release
  ledger as open coverage.
- **New installations get the restrained card.** With no value recorded, `dialogueMenuStyle` is now
  `MINIMAL` and `motionMode` is `REDUCED` — the same numbered menu, the same input, drawn flat and
  animated only when it opens and closes. This reaches an absent key only: Forge writes every option
  into `mcaconversations-client.toml` the first time it saves the file, so an existing installation
  already states both keys and keeps them. A stored `RESPONSIVE` or `FULL` is a choice and is never
  read as a stale default, and `numberedResponses = false` still overrides everything with MCA's own
  menu.
- **Reduced motion is now a fade and nothing else.** Under `REDUCED` the card fades in when the menu
  genuinely opens and out when it closes; focus, selection, expanding a clipped answer and turning
  the page happen at once. The entrance is keyed to the lifetime of the menu rather than to each
  offer, so a slow turn between two questions is the card waiting rather than closing and reopening,
  and a new question replaces the text without moving or re-fading the panel. Under `FULL` the
  responsive card is unchanged, including its per-question row cascade.
- **MINIMAL says more with the same few rectangles.** One hairline marks where the villager's line
  ends and the answers begin, the backing carries more contrast behind the text, and a focused row is
  a fill plus a two-pixel mark in its own left gutter: the whole row is the click target, and the
  numeral and answer text sit at the same coordinates focused or not. A confirmed choice adds a white
  outline, so the two states still differ by more than a shade of grey, and there is still no
  portrait, no badge artwork and no pop-out.
- **README describes the card that ships.** The panel is flat backing fills and gradients, not the
  vanilla `options_background.png` dirt the README still claimed; the number badges and page buttons
  are still nine-sliced from `widgets.png`. Motion settings are described as Conversations-owned
  effects, and Townstead keeps its own screen, camera and typewriter.

### Added

- **The dialogue directory is validated before MCA applies it.** Half of this mod's shipped content
  is dialogue JSON that MCA's own listener owns, and nothing here used to read it. The reload now
  indexes the effective `dialogues/**` across namespaces, modelling MCA's own key, merge and
  priority rules, so a pack that repoints an owned answer at a question nothing declares is a
  refused reload rather than a dead button discovered mid-conversation. Routes out to MCA's own
  questions stay legal and are recorded as what they are: a boundary this mod does not cover.

- **The card can show what was actually said.** `H`, or the first button in the footer strip, opens a
  drawer of the lines this client received and the responses it sent, each reply with its truthful
  status: sent, accepted, or refused with the reason the server gave. It records the resolved line at
  the moment the client receives it rather than looking an id up again, so a pooled line reads back
  as the sentence that was spoken; one utterance is one entry however many surfaces it reached. The
  drawer is collapsed by default, holds only this client's own deliveries, is bounded by the new
  `deliveredHistoryEntries` client setting, and is cleared on disconnect and world change. Nothing is
  written to disk and nothing can be exported.
- **A presentation pane inside the card.** `P`, or the second footer button, changes the menu style,
  motion, line reveal, interface sound volume and control hints in place, writing them to
  `mcaconversations-client.toml`. When the legacy `numberedResponses = false` switch is forcing MCA's
  own menu, the style row states both the style you configured and the one being drawn. "Reset to
  recommended" lists exactly what it would change and applies it only when chosen again. With
  Townstead installed the pane says that Townstead draws its own dialogue screen and these settings
  do not govern it. Both overlays live inside the response viewport, so the panel and the villager's
  line stay where they were; while one is open no key or click reaches the answer list, so opening a
  utility can never select a response, and Back, Escape, Backspace or Tab hands the keyboard back to
  the region it came from.
- **An offered topic that cannot be opened says why.** Asking a villager about an entry their own
  menu was showing now answers in plain words — they are working, the two of you already talked about
  it today, they are not ready to talk about that — instead of falling through in silence. The
  sentence names no topic id, no condition and no eligibility reason; it is produced only for
  something the player was already offered, so nothing hidden, undiscovered or age-gated is ever
  mentioned; and it describes a refusal that has already happened rather than granting anything.
  Selecting the topic still goes through the server's ordinary gate. Network and execution problems
  are not villager refusals and keep their existing lapse explanations.
- **Keyboard reading and region focus.** Tab and Shift-Tab move between the question, the response
  list and the page controls. In the question or while reading a response, the arrows, Home, End,
  Page Up and Page Down read the text; in the ordinary list they still move the selection and turn
  pages. `R` reads the focused response and stops reading it again, Escape leaves reading mode before
  it closes the screen, and a keyboard selection is always scrolled into view. The reading action is
  named in the footer hint and announced to the narrator.
- **One model of the available controls.** The footer hint and the narrator are built from the same
  description of what can actually be pressed. A disabled numeric shortcut is never advertised or
  announced, narration says "Response 10 of 12. Shortcut 1." only when there is a shortcut, and the
  hint is measured against the space left after the page text and the page controls, falling back to
  shorter localized variants and finally to nothing rather than overlapping them.
- **Held confirmation now needs a release.** Enter, keypad Enter, Space, the enabled digits and the
  card's own pointer confirmation each confirm once per press. A key held across an immediately
  available next question no longer walks the player through nodes they never read; the repeat is
  consumed rather than falling through to a stale native control, and a release followed by a new
  press works immediately, with no waiting interval. Releases are tracked while no offer is up, and
  reconciled against the window so a release lost to a focus change or a screen swap recovers itself.

- **Continuity has reserved seats in scene admission.** The director used to sort every eligible
  scene by authored priority and score only the first 32, so a low-priority scene that carried a due
  promise, an unresolved rupture or a ready thread could be cut before its continuity weight was ever
  applied. Up to 8 scored positions are now reserved for scenes tied to a due obligation and up to 8
  more for unresolved continuity, filled from load-time thread and subject indexes so the 128-entry
  merge cap cannot hide them; the remaining positions follow ordinary priority. Every reserved scene
  passes the same eligibility, privacy, recency and binding gates, a rejected one gives its seat back,
  and one bounded evaluation budget now also covers the fallback traversal. The selection
  explanation reports evaluated, rejected, reserved, scored and budget-exhausted counts. Scoring
  itself is unchanged: relevance earns admission, not certainty.
- **The reload transaction boundary is written down and probed.** `docs/RELOAD-TRANSACTION-BOUNDARY.md`
  inventories every catalog this mod loads, which loaders retain their previous index and which
  skip-and-publish, the add-on dialogue data that MCA's own `Dialogues` listener loads, MCA's
  reload members per supported version, the ordering race between the two mods' reload handlers,
  a recommended retention strategy and its eight documented limitations. `McaDialogueReloadProbeTest`
  demonstrates the relevant `Dialogues` behaviour against every jar in `mca_probe_versions`, and
  `ReloadTransactionBaselineTest` documents the old mixed loader verdicts and now verifies the staged
  coordinator's replacement behavior. The investigation established the boundary used by the
  transactional reload implementation in this release.

- **A subject a villager asked your opinion about, and came back to.** `shared_history` gains
  an episode family about advice: a small matter the villager puts to you while it is
  undecided, and three authored ways back to it once it is not. They report what they did with your
  answer — followed it, kept half of it, or went the other way for a reason they will state; they can
  admit they took it more heavily than you meant it, and you can say what you actually meant, accept
  their reading, or hold that it was only ever an opinion; and once it is long settled they name it
  again as something the two of you worked out, and nothing else. Every page offers listening,
  advice, practical help that promises nothing, respectful disagreement, a question, and a graceful
  postponement, and only the reply that closes the subject settles the thread, so returning to it
  cannot reopen what was finished or pay anything a second time. The scenes are the thread's authored
  resume targets, so the continuation route added in this release has somewhere honest to land.
- **A village change that has moved on since you last asked.** `village` gains a scene that only
  plays when several days have passed, and says what became of the news rather than introducing it
  again: it has stopped being the first thing anybody mentions, it sits heavier on the lane than it
  did, or it now matters less than the state of a roof. You can ask what shifted, say that sounds
  like a relief, or put it plainly that quieter is not the same as over — which the villager grants.
- **Two harmless things to talk about.** A neighbour preparing to go to a gathering, three days into
  deciding what to carry over, where offering to carry something is answered with "if you are about,
  that is welcome; if you are not, nobody will be waiting on you" — an offer, stated as not a
  promise. And, once you have known each other a while, the thing about their own hobby that still
  makes them laugh: a misheard tune whistled all winter, a first attempt mostly worn by a
  neighbour's cat, a drawer of very serious and very bad early evidence. No quest, no promise, no
  repeatable reward; the payoff is learning something about the person.
- **A mason and their apprentice, stuck on nothing important.** Asking whether the two of them ever
  disagree about method opens a standing, friendly impasse — wet stone against dry, joint widths,
  whether you point the seam the same day — where you can side with the apprentice, ask who taught
  each habit, or say it sounds like a good site to work on. The wall goes up straight either way.
- **Four of the new openings are written in a villager's own voice.** The warm, quiet, plainspoken
  and bright families each carry an authored variant set for one of the new scenes, so the first line
  of each is not narrated by the same voice for everyone.

## [1.6.3] - unreleased

1.6.3 is a stabilization release that repairs correctness defects found by a September 2026 audit of
the conversation systems (`docs/MCAConversations-Conversation-Systems-Research-and-Implementation-Plan.md`
in the Forge repository), for both Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge and 1.21.1 NeoForge. Version 1.6.2 is
skipped so the add-on suite shares the 1.6.3 number: MCA: Quests is releasing 1.6.3 and 1.6.4
alongside.

### Fixed

- **A clean checkout now builds.** The optional MCA: Quests and MCA: Reputation integrations were
  compiled against whatever class directory happened to sit in a neighbouring checkout (`build.gradle`
  defaulted to `../MCAQuests_1.21.1/build/classes/java/main` and
  `../MCAReputation_1.21.1/build/classes/java/main`), and when it was absent the build warned and
  silently excluded the affected integration sources from compilation, so the GitHub Actions build
  never failed loudly but shipped a jar with the optional integration quietly missing. MCA: Quests
  1.6.4 and MCA: Reputation 0.4.1 now ship compile-only API jars; this repo vendors them under
  `libs/api/` with a manifest `gradle/sibling-apis.properties` recording version, provider commit and
  SHA-256, a `verifySiblingApis` task checks the hash before `compileJava`, and a missing or mismatched
  jar fails the build with the expected path and hash instead of dropping the integration. The
  `-PmcaQuestsApiPath` / `-PmcaReputationApiPath` overrides still work for developers iterating against
  a provider working tree. The API jars are compile-only: nothing from them is packaged, and the
  jar-contents check now fails if any provider class leaks into the mod jar.
- **Nine conversation starters were gated on a token MCA does not recognise.** The answers `routine`,
  `interests`, `player`, `origin`, `place`, `crown`, `court`, `house` and `realm` in
  `data/mcaconversations/dialogues/conversations.cat.{chitchat,personal,village}.json` carried
  `!child` in their `constraints`; MCA's real `Constraint` registry has no `child` entry (checked in as
  `NativeConstraintTokens`, cross-checked against real MCA jars by `ConstraintVocabularyProbeTest`),
  and MCA drops a token it does not recognise instead of rejecting it, so the exclusion those answers
  were written to express never happened and the topics were offered to child villagers. They now use
  `!baby,!toddler`; the teen-and-adult intent itself is carried by the catalog's `ages` allow-list, not
  by a constraint (see the next entry). `ContentLintTest` now fails the build if any shipped constraint
  token is not one MCA actually has. This port's `NativeConstraintTokens` also lists `relative` and
  `riding`, which are present on every MCA build this port's declared range (`[7.7.13,8)`) can run
  against — the 1.20.1 Forge build's token list omits them because they are absent from MCA 7.6.
- **A misspelled feature id no longer counts as enabled.** `McaConversationsConfig.isFeatureEnabled`
  used to fall through to `true` for an id it did not recognise, so a typo in a
  `conversations_enabled`/`conversations_disabled` condition switched content on, or left the sink it
  was meant to trigger permanently unable to fire. Feature ids now resolve through one closed registry,
  `FeatureId`; an id neither condition recognises invalidates the rule (both score 0) with a single
  warning naming the raw id, and an unknown id read through `McaConversationsConfig.isFeatureEnabled(String)`
  directly is likewise treated as disabled with one warning. `FeatureOffLintTest` now checks that every
  feature id in the shipped data and the sample datapacks resolves through `FeatureId`.
- **A villager at the corner of the chat box could earn hearts for a reply it never gave.** Chat-mode
  targeting (`chat/VillagerFinder`) gathered candidates from an inflated bounding box — a cube, up to
  `sqrt(3)·radius` from the player — while delivery (`chat/ChatDelivery`) checked a sphere of the same
  radius, so a villager standing between the two (for example at three quarters of the radius along
  both horizontal axes) was a valid target: MCA ran the answer's effects for it, and the reply was then
  discarded at delivery. Candidate search (`VillagerFinder.rank`) now filters to the sphere before
  ranking, and one engagement policy (`conversation/EngagementPolicy`: speaker connected and alive,
  villager alive, same dimension, within range) is re-evaluated immediately before MCA's answer runs
  (`chat/ChatModeDispatcher#driveStaggered`), at delivery time (`chat/ChatDelivery#deliver`), and for
  GUI/numbered choices (`conversation/ChoiceSelectionService`); when it fails, no effect runs, no reply
  is scheduled, and the exchange ends quietly. Candidates tied at equal distance now rank
  deterministically by name then UUID.
- **Capitals data could outlive the world it came from.** The MCA: Capitals residency cache and the
  record cache (`compat/capitals/ReflectiveCapitalsBridge`) lived for the whole game process, keyed
  only by expiry tick — the record cache had no size limit and no expiry check at all — and nothing
  cleared either one when a server stopped, so opening another world in the same session, or
  restoring an older save, could answer a court question from the previous world's data, and a clock
  moved backwards could keep an entry fresh indefinitely. Every cached entry is now stamped with a
  per-server epoch (`compat/ServerEpoch`) and its creation tick; an entry is served only when the
  epoch matches the running server, its expiry tick is still ahead, and the clock has not moved
  behind its creation tick (`compat/CacheLifetime`); both caches now share one bound and are emptied
  on server stop (`event/ConversationsEvents#onServerStopped` clears the caches, then advances the
  epoch) while the reflective handles stay bound. MCA: Capitals remains optional; the fix changes
  nothing when it is absent, since `NoopCapitalsBridge` inherits an empty `clearCaches`.
- **A history save written by a newer version is now left alone.** Loading projected the fields it
  recognised and wrote the current schema version back (`ConversationHistoryStore#save`), silently
  discarding the rest, so a world briefly opened with a later build and then rolled back lost whatever
  that build had added. A store whose version is newer than this mod's (`ConversationHistoryStore#load`)
  now runs read-only for the session (`isDegraded`, enforced by `ConversationHistorySavedData#setDirty`),
  conversations continue on what it can read, and any save re-emits the original tag byte for byte. The
  schema version is unchanged (still 1); new keys are optional.
- **Decoding a history file now respects the same limits as playing.** The load path
  (`VillagerHistory#load`, `PairHistory#load`) used to insert villagers, pairs, episodes, opinions,
  roles, threads, commitments, claims and recency stamps straight into their maps, so a hand-edited or
  oversized file bypassed every cap; free text had no length limit anywhere. Every collection is now
  capped on load by a deterministic rule that drops settled, closed and low-salience records before
  obligations and disputes (each collection has its own order, mirroring what the game keeps when
  adding — see `VillagerHistory#enforceLoadedCaps` and `PairHistory#enforceLoadedCaps`); if a file
  still exceeds a hard cap after that, the oldest entries go regardless of obligation
  (`PairHistory#trimToHardCap`), and the original file is backed up first. Free text is cut at 512
  code points (`HistoryCaps.MAX_TEXT_LENGTH`, `HistoryCaps#text`), `recordCount` now counts roles and
  recency, and when a load actually discards something the original data is written once to a sibling
  store `mcaconversations_history_backup` (`ConversationHistoryBackupSavedData`, never read by the
  mod; safe to delete).
- **A datapack reload no longer leaves a stale choice armed.** Each catalog used to publish
  independently, and the conversation catalog merged files in whatever order the resource map
  happened to iterate, so a topic id declared in two files resolved arbitrarily and silently; an offer
  made before a reload could also still be submitted afterwards against content that had changed or
  vanished. `ConversationCatalogLoader` now merges files in a fixed sorted order and reports a
  duplicate topic id with both source files and the file that won. After every reload completes, one
  numbered content generation is published (`ContentGenerationListener`, registered last in
  `ConversationsEvents#onAddReloadListeners` so it runs after every other catalog loader, logging
  "Conversation content generation {} published."). Each offer now records the generation it was made
  under (`ConversationSession.ChoiceOffer#generation`), and a choice submitted against an older
  generation is refused and its topic ended instead of executing (`ConversationGuard`,
  `ChoiceSelectionService`). For a numbered choice, `ChoiceSelectionService` tells the client the offer
  expired through the existing packet reason, so there is no protocol change; for the dialogue-screen
  path, `ConversationGuard`'s caller in `mixin/InteractionDialogueMessageMixin` cancels the packet
  before MCA sees it, and the submission is cancelled with no notification sent. A live conversation is
  not force-closed by a reload on its own.
- **A village called "Ash Hollow" was being looked up as if it were a translation key, and equal
  contexts could hash differently.** Two independent defects. First, the scene binder
  (`scene/SlotBinder`, the `"village"` case) lowercased a villager's real village name into an
  authored-token slot, which `template/SlotRenderer`'s `TOKEN` case then passed through the language
  file, so an unauthored name surfaced in dialogue as a raw key such as
  `mcaconversations.slot.ash_hollow`. Second, `context/ContextValue#token()` — the encoding
  `context/ContextFingerprint` hashes — rendered every value with `String.valueOf`, so a set-valued
  fact (`context/ContextKeys` marks several fields `Set`/`List`) produced a different string depending
  on iteration order, and a status name could alias a literal string spelled the same way. The village
  name is now bound as a sanitised `history/NarrativeValue` literal (`Kind.LITERAL`, `literal()`;
  formatting codes stripped and length capped at `MAX_LITERAL_LENGTH` by `sanitize()`) and rendered
  verbatim by `SlotRenderer`'s new `LITERAL` case, falling back through `fallbackFor` to the existing
  `mcaconversations.fallback.village` text when the name is unknown. `ContextValue#token()` now uses
  one canonical type-tagged encoding — sorted sets, order-preserving length-prefixed lists, escaped
  delimiters, a `status:` prefix that cannot alias a literal string, and locale-independent numbers —
  underneath the unchanged `ContextFingerprint`. Fingerprints are never persisted, so existing saves are
  unaffected, and a literal value can never come from authored content: `NarrativeValue.parse` maps
  `literal:` to empty. Covered by `ContextFingerprintTest`, `SlotRendererTest` and `SlotBinderTest`; not
  separately verified in-game.
- **Eviction picks the villager you actually stopped talking to.** When the villager cap was hit, the
  fallback victim used to be whichever entry came first in map order, which could change after a
  restart and need not be inactive. Eviction (`ConversationHistoryStore#evictionCandidate`) now skips
  villagers with an unresolved commitment, a live thread, or an open conversation
  (`VillagerHistory#isProtected`, `ConversationSessions#hasSessionWith` via `setLiveSessionPredicate`),
  then prefers empty histories, then the oldest persisted `last_activity` day (derived from existing
  pair data for older saves), then a fixed UUID order, so the victim is the same before and after a
  reload; if every villager is protected nothing is evicted and the new history is kept out of the
  store with a diagnostic rather than dropping an obligation.
- **A villager could remember telling you something you never saw, and some ways of leaving left
  state behind.** A delayed chat reply that got dropped because the player walked away, died or
  logged out had already been recorded as played at the moment the answer was chosen; and the several
  ways a conversation could end — full teardowns (logout, player or villager death, timeout, server
  stop, and an out-of-range/dimension-change/player-gone abort before an answer runs) and topic-only
  endings that leave the session in place (an authored ending, a reload refusal) — each cleared a
  different subset of state, so an attention lease or a queued line could survive its own
  conversation. Every close path now names its reason
  (`conversation/CloseReason`, an operational fact never a social consequence — `PLAYER_LEFT` is not a
  snub and `TIMED_OUT` is not boredom), and one teardown, `ConversationSessions#close`, ends the topic,
  releases both the villager's and the player's attention leases, and drops that player's queued lines
  (`ChatModeScheduler#clearPlayer`) every time; `#endTopic` alone still does not drop a queued line, so
  a farewell already in flight is kept. For free-text chat, a scene is now recorded as played only once
  its first reply line actually reaches the player (`scene/ConversationPlanner#onScenePlayed` deferring
  through `chat/ChatModeSession#deferUntilDelivered`, fired by `chat/ChatDelivery#deliver` after the
  speaker receives the line, with a turn-time fallback when no line was scheduled) — a dropped reply is
  not remembered as heard, while the player's own accepted choice and everything MCA wrote stay
  recorded at turn time either way; the dialogue-screen frontend, whose packet is already on the wire,
  keeps recording at turn time as before. Four of the twelve close reasons (`SPEAKER_UNAVAILABLE`,
  `FEATURE_DISABLED`, `INVALID_OFFER`, `CONTAINED_ERROR`) are reserved for later work — nothing closes
  for them yet — and nothing on the network changed. Covered by `SessionCloseReasonTest`,
  `ChatModeSchedulerTest` and `ChatDeliveryTest`; not verified in-game.

### Changed

- **Continuous integration now runs the content drift gates.** `verifyGeneratedConversationContent`
  and `verifyVoiceOverlays` are invoked by name in the `test` job's build step, next to `build` (they
  are still not part of `check`, by design), so editing a generated resource without regenerating it,
  or an authoring source without committing the regenerated output, fails CI.
- **Topic age gates authored in the catalog are now enforced on every entry path.**
  `conversation_catalog/topics.json` has always declared an `ages` allow-list per topic, but
  `TopicEntry.allowsAge` had no callers. A shared predicate, `conversation/TopicAgeGate` (backed by the
  `conversation/AgeGroup` vocabulary — `baby, toddler, child, teen, adult`, where an unreadable age
  never passes a positive list), is now applied in the MCA dialogue screen's answer list
  (`mixin/QuestionMixin`), on direct answer submissions (`mixin/InteractionDialogueMessageMixin`,
  `conversation/ChoiceSelectionService`), and in free-text chat matching (`chat/GatePreview`); dynamic
  hub routing (`hub/DynamicHub`) applies the same `TopicEntry.allowsAge` check to its slots directly,
  in `withoutTopicsTooOldFor`. Topics declared adult-only or child-and-up are now hidden
  from younger villagers everywhere, not just where MCA's native constraints happened to reach; the
  `QuestionMixin` injection into `getValidAnswers` now captures the villager argument so it can make
  that call. Datapack authors' `ages` values are still validated on load, and an unknown value is
  still rejected.
- **Ordinary chat is observed after every other handler has had its say.** The single chat listener
  (`event/ConversationsEvents#onServerChat`) ran at `EventPriority.HIGH` and copied the raw text before
  other mods could cancel or rewrite the message. It now listens at `EventPriority.LOWEST`, skips
  cancelled events, and matches the final message text, so a message another mod cancels never reaches
  a villager and a rewritten message is matched as rewritten; the experimental local-chat mode
  (`chatModeLocalChat`, default off, `#onLocalChat`) keeps its early `HIGH` slot because it must own
  cancellation, and a message is never processed by both paths. On the ordinary path, the text handed
  to the server thread is now taken from the final message component into an immutable
  `chat/AcceptedChat` snapshot on the event thread, so a rewrite by a later handler is what gets
  matched; the local-chat owner keeps the raw text it re-broadcasts, because it owns presentation.
  Bystanders who
  overhear a public reply (`chat/ChatDelivery#deliver`) are now checked by the same engagement policy
  individually, rather than by a bare connection/distance test.

## [1.6.1] - unreleased

Stabilization, dialogue refinement and content expansion for Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge and 1.21.1 NeoForge.

### Stabilization and bilingual narrative pass (2026-09)

- Rewrote all 60 ordinary dynamic topic scenes in English and Brazilian Portuguese, repaired seven shared follow-up funnels, and added eight deeper reply pages. Responses, conditions, memories and callbacks now refer to supported state; unrelated branch details no longer converge into contradictory follow-ups.
- Expanded Capitals to 55 contextual scenes, including 13 new scenes with multi-turn continuations about law, petitions, hearings, ceremonies, civic work, loyalty, disagreement and diplomacy. Existing succession, court, house, news and standing scenes now use explicit knowledge, trust and privacy gates. Added all four Capitals menu routes to free-text chat.
- Corrected Portuguese negation and reply matching, made complete offered phrases choose their exact response, and expanded generated bilingual intent fixtures. Strengthened source/graph/translation/claim contract validation; see the review reports for exact coverage and remaining in-game checks.
- Unified server offer consumption across GUI, numbered chat and text; rejected stale/replayed or wrong-target replies; kept budgets and bound scene plans when reopening an active exchange; corrected connection and lifecycle cleanup.
- Preserved delayed reply order and group privacy, stopped ambient responders from overwriting an unanswered exchange, and restricted bystander statements to knowledge they actually hold. Added substantive personality coverage and corrected older voice/legacy claims about specific weekdays, recent events, and future content.
- Fixed bounded-store eviction/save loss, first-write disposition baselines, clamped daily accounting, daily rewards consuming lifetime memory, and untrackable one-time rewards. Existing saves retain their earned history.
- Corrected exact quest-promise outcomes, unavailable resolver behavior, lapsed-thread/abandoned-episode persistence and receiver-aware rumor delivery. Anonymous retellings remove entity-reference payloads.
- Made partial Capitals capability failures unknown, corrected heir/abdication news classification, and retained real court titles. Verified reflection probes against actual matching Capitals and Townstead jars on both loaders.
- Added optional Gradle API-path properties for reproducible builds against sibling integrations. Documented reproduction, compatibility evidence, review boundaries and production checks in `docs/STABILIZATION-2026-09.md` and `docs/MCA_CAPITALS_SUPPORT.md`.

### Documentation

- Added `datapack_samples/` — ten worked example datapacks covering the documented vocabulary end to
  end: a first topic, a new hub category, checked stances and the disposition vector, arcs,
  milestones and observable promises, the living-histories layer, village culture, world and
  optional-mod compatibility, a third-party profession, and two packs on modifying and removing
  shipped content. Each carries a file-by-file walkthrough explaining why it is written as it is.
  Ported from the 1.20.1 Forge set; every pack is byte-identical to its Forge counterpart except
  where a 1.21.1 difference required otherwise.
- Each sample ships as `datapack/` and `resourcepack/` halves, because 1.21.1 uses pack format **48**
  for data and **34** for resources — unlike 1.20.1, where a single manifest at format 15 serves
  both. The two halves install into `datapacks/` and `resourcepacks/` respectively.
- Samples naming a personality were re-pointed off `confident`, `peppy` and `athletic`, which MCA no
  longer registers on 1.21.1: no generated villager can be one, though the ids still resolve for
  upgraded saves and the mod still ships their voices.
- Two vocabulary facts confirmed against `mca-neoforge-7.7.33+1.21.1.jar` and recorded in the
  samples, because both fail silently: MCA's constraint registry has no `child` token and drops
  unrecognised tokens without logging, and `isFeatureEnabled` returns `true` for an unknown feature
  id, so a misspelt `conversations_disabled` sink never fires. Both behave identically to 1.20.1.
- Moved the loose specifications at the repository root (`chat-mode-spec.md`, `mca-conversations.md`,
  `MCA-Conversations-1.0.0-RPG-Expansion.md`, `MCA-Conversations-1.21.1-NeoForge-Port-Plan.md`,
  `MCAConversationsContentReviewandExpansion.md`) into `docs/`, leaving `README`, `CHANGELOG`,
  `CONFIG`, `DATAPACK`, `CURSEFORGE`, `LICENSE`, `PARITY` and `PORT_STATUS` at the top level.

### Compatibility

- Forge artifact version: `1.6.1`; NeoForge artifact version: `1.6.1+1.21.1`.
- Existing saves and configuration remain supported. Network protocol remains `2`.
- Full builds and content validation passed on both loaders. Production gameplay checks are listed in `docs/STABILIZATION-2026-09.md`.

---

## [1.6.0] - unreleased

Integration with the optional MCA: Capitals monarchy add-on, plus the unreleased 1.5.2 dialogue presentation expansion. Version 1.6.0 supersedes the unreleased 1.5.2; the presentation work is included here. The subsequent stabilization and content pass is recorded under 1.6.1.

### Added

- **MCA: Capitals integration** — villages that are capitals carry court news as gossip, villagers speak about their sovereign, heirs, houses, rivals and allies, and a villager whose title just changed remarks on it unprompted. Chronicle diffs and court snapshots are polled server-side and seeded into the village gossip sweep. Requires MCA Capitals 1.3+ (tested against 1.3.6 on the 1.20.1 Forge line; on this NeoForge 1.21.1 line, `capitalsProbeTest` resolves the binding manifest FULL, 9 capabilities, zero unresolved members, against MCA Capitals 1.3.5). The integration is read-only and requires only MCA; the Capitals mod is entirely optional.
- Eleven new gossip event types seeded from Capitals: `coronation`, `royal_marriage`, `royal_birth`, `royal_death`, `appointment`, `disgrace`, `war`, `peace`, `alliance`, `capital_founded`, `court_news`.
- Four new conversation topics gated by `capital_topics`: the crown, the court, houses, the realm (authored inside the topics pack; enable/disable per-capital via the `capitals` master switch).
- Twenty-six `capital.*` context fields: capital name, sovereign/heir details, court office, house and house tier, at-war/allied state, mourning status, player allegiance, and whether this villager just got a title change.
- Nine new template variables for dialogue lines speaking about court: `capital_name`, `sovereign_name`, `sovereign_title`, `heir_name`, `house_name`, `house_words`, `villager_title`, `rival_capital_name`, `ally_capital_name`. All fall back to neutral text when the capital is absent or a detail is vacant.
- `COURT_REMARK` scene purpose: a villager opens unprompted when their court title changes, with the same interruption cost as `STANDING_REMARK`.
- `STANDING_REMARK` scene purpose for the optional Reputation integration (unreleased, part of this release): a villager remarks when the player's village standing crosses a tier.
- `vars_used` optional field on scenes and reactions in the topic pack compiler, documenting which template variables a scene expects. Purely informational; no enforcement.
- `[capitals]` config section (10 keys): master switch, topic and news toggles, poll cadence and per-poll caps, diplomacy talk, role remarks, context cache, and debug logging.
- `mcaconversations_court` SavedData: persists capital names, their sovereign/heir/mourning state, and the chronicle cursor for news polling, per world.
- `capitalsProbeTest` Gradle task: verifies binding against the actual MCA Capitals jar when `-PcapitalsJar=...` is supplied.

- Three dialogue presentation choices: **Current** (the full responsive card), **Minimal** (responsive interaction with simpler graphics and no live portrait), and **Original MCA** (MCA Reborn's native interface).
- Explicit `dialogueMenuStyle` client configuration option in `config/mcaconversations-client.toml`.
- `MINIMAL` presentation layer: uses the same synchronized offer, keyboard navigation, paging, and accessibility systems as the responsive card, but with flat-panel graphics and no entity portrait rendering, reducing visual complexity and rendering overhead.

### Changed

- Original MCA presentation is now a first-class documented option (`dialogueMenuStyle = "MCA_ORIGINAL"`), rather than being discoverable only through the legacy `numberedResponses = false` setting.
- `motionMode = OFF` is documented as the canonical way to disable every dialogue animation: card entrance, row cascading, focus transitions, page motion, exit fade, and question reveal.
- Client presentation configuration is resolved centrally through `ClientChoiceController`, so the responsive card and MCA's native interface never disagree about input ownership.
- `MINIMAL` presentation uses restrained motion under `motionMode = FULL`: no row cascade, no focus pop-out, and no selection press movement, with entrance and page transitions reduced to a short two-pixel slide.
- Responsive card body now draws as a flat, translucent backing instead of tiling the vanilla options background; number badges and page buttons still use `widgets.png` and follow resource packs.

### Fixed

- The Conversations response card no longer disappears on the first click after a minute or so of reading, exposing MCA's own answer list underneath. A dialogue-screen offer used to age out with the conversation session timeout (`conversationSessionTimeoutTicks`, server config) and be dropped by the session's inactivity expiry, so the next selection was rejected as expired. A screen offer now lives for as long as MCA keeps the interaction screen open on that villager; chat-mode offers still expire with the session.

### Known limitations

- Chronicle text quoted in gossip renders in the server's locale, not the player's.

### Compatibility

- Existing `numberedResponses = false` configurations continue to restore MCA's native dialogue UI automatically.
- Existing `motionMode` values (`FULL`, `REDUCED`, `OFF`) retain their exact meaning and behavior.
- Network protocol remains `2` — no new packets.
- Saves: new `mcaconversations_court` SavedData holds capital snapshots and chronicle cursors. Datapacks and server configuration gain a `[capitals]` section with documented defaults.

## [1.5.2] - unreleased

Dialogue presentation expansion: three clearly differentiated interface choices (Current, Minimal, and Original MCA), explicit `dialogueMenuStyle` configuration, and improvements to motion control documentation.

### Added

- Three dialogue presentation choices: **Current** (the full responsive card), **Minimal** (responsive interaction with simpler graphics and no live portrait), and **Original MCA** (MCA Reborn's native interface).
- Explicit `dialogueMenuStyle` client configuration option in `config/mcaconversations-client.toml`.
- `MINIMAL` presentation layer: uses the same synchronized offer, keyboard navigation, paging, and accessibility systems as the responsive card, but with flat-panel graphics and no entity portrait rendering, reducing visual complexity and rendering overhead.

### Changed

- Original MCA presentation is now a first-class documented option (`dialogueMenuStyle = "MCA_ORIGINAL"`), rather than being discoverable only through the legacy `numberedResponses = false` setting.
- `motionMode = OFF` is documented as the canonical way to disable every dialogue animation: card entrance, row cascading, focus transitions, page motion, exit fade, and question reveal.
- Client presentation configuration is resolved centrally through `ClientChoiceController`, so the responsive card and MCA's native interface never disagree about input ownership.
- `MINIMAL` presentation uses restrained motion under `motionMode = FULL`: no row cascade, no focus pop-out, and no selection press movement, with entrance and page transitions reduced to a short two-pixel slide.

### Fixed

- The Conversations response card no longer disappears on the first click after a minute or so of reading, exposing MCA's own answer list underneath. A dialogue-screen offer used to age out with the conversation session timeout (`conversationSessionTimeoutTicks`, server config) and be dropped by the session's inactivity expiry, so the next selection was rejected as expired. A screen offer now lives for as long as MCA keeps the interaction screen open on that villager; chat-mode offers still expire with the session.

### Compatibility

- Existing `numberedResponses = false` configurations continue to restore MCA's native dialogue UI automatically.
- Existing `motionMode` values (`FULL`, `REDUCED`, `OFF`) retain their exact meaning and behavior.
- Network protocol remains `2` — no new packets.
- Saves, datapacks, and server configuration are unchanged.

## [1.5.1] - unreleased

The Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge line. No feature was added, removed or redesigned: every topic,
every line, every config key and every saved byte is what 1.2.1 shipped. What changed is the
platform underneath, and two bugs that the port surfaced.

### Fixed

- **Refused gifts were recorded as accepted.** MCA decides inside `acceptGift` whether it will
  actually take an item: it turns the gift down when the villager's inventory is full, when the
  response scores as a failure, and again when repetition drags an otherwise-fine gift down to a
  failure. The gift observer hooked the *start* of that method, so all three rejections were
  written down as gifts received — granting gratitude, and leaving a `last_gift_item` a villager
  would then talk about having been given something they had just handed back. The hook now sits on
  the single point where MCA takes the item, and records exactly one of it.
- **The one-locale personality gate was documented as two.** The hook that lets Brazilian
  Portuguese resolve per-personality dialogue described MCA as allowing `en_us` and `ru_ru`. MCA
  allows `en_us` alone. The behaviour was already correct; only the explanation was wrong, and it
  was the explanation someone would have relied on.

### Changed — platform

- Minecraft 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.234+, Java 21, built with ModDevGradle instead of ForgeGradle.
- Player data moved from Forge capabilities to NeoForge data attachments. **Your remembered gifts
  and your chat-mode choice are imported automatically** the first time each player loads an
  upgraded world, and data you have already created on 1.21.1 is never overwritten.
- The three world files — `mcaconversations_dispositions.dat`, `mcaconversations_gossip.dat`,
  `mcaconversations_progress.dat` — keep their names and their contents. Dispositions, gossip and
  conversation progress carry over untouched.
- The typing-attention packet was rebuilt on the 1.21 payload system. It still carries one boolean
  and nothing else, and the server still re-derives the player and re-checks every gate itself.
- The personality roster is now the fourteen MCA actually registers on 1.21.1. `confident` and
  `peppy` are no longer among them, so no new villager is one; their voices ship anyway, alongside
  `athletic`, so a villager who already *is* one keeps speaking in character instead of falling
  back to the generic pool.
- The villager-line mixin is gone. It existed to stop MCA re-parsing a line out of JSON on every
  read, which made the menu and the chat copy draw different random variants. MCA now passes one
  finished line to both, so there is nothing left to fix.

### Known limitations

- **MCA: Quests and MCA: Reputation integrations are dormant.** Neither has a 1.21.1 NeoForge
  release. Quest-aware conversation lines never fire and reputation-aware dialogue scores zero —
  the same behaviour as an install without those mods. The code is still here and comes back when
  they do.
- **Back up before upgrading.** Conversations migrates its own data, but MCA 7.7.36 also changes
  how it persists personalities and traits compared with older 7.7 builds, and that conversion is
  MCA's, not ours.

### For developers

- `docs/PORT-1.21.1-EVIDENCE.md` records the exact MCA jar this was built against, its SHA-256, and
  every mixin target descriptor read out of that binary.
- Unlike the 1.20.1 line, `runClient` and `runServer` are real tests of MCA integration: MCA's
  1.21.1 jar uses official Mojang names and loads as a normal mod in development. On 1.20.1 its
  mixins were SRG-named with no refmap, so only a production instance could exercise them.

## [1.2.1] - unreleased

A content pass over every shipped conversation, in both locales. Nothing here changes a system;
it fixes lines that reached the screen wrong and exchanges that did not cohere once read end to end.

### Fixed — lines that rendered as their own source code

- **Four topic openers showed the player a raw format string.** A plain `say` hands MCA exactly one
  argument — the spouse-aware player name at `%1$s` — but `conversations.village.home`,
  `conversations.us.happy.grateful`, `conversations.us.firstmet.memory` and
  `conversations.family.memories.share` each named `%2$s`. Minecraft catches that at render and
  substitutes the untouched template, so *"What's it like living here?"* answered with a literal
  *"%2$s? It's home."* — and because all 21 personality overlays override `village.home`, every
  villager in the game was broken on it. The three that wanted a real value are now
  `conversations_say` with the variable they were written for; the family story, which wanted a
  relative's name and no template variable supplies one, names one of the villager's own instead.
- **Six pooled families wrote their template variable at `%1$s`.** The declared var was never read,
  so the resolved value was discarded and the player's own name landed in the noun slot: *"Why? In
  **Steve** you don't ask why."*, *"that **Steve** you brought me is still doing its work."*, *"In
  **Steve**? Whatever's ripe…"* The season, weather, holiday and last-gift hooks never once reached
  the screen. Moved to `%2$s` in both locales.
- **One result spoke twice.** `topic.checkin.good.respond#ask_more` carried both a
  `conversations_say` and a `say`; both push a finished line, so the client kept whichever landed
  last and the holiday line — variable and all — was resolved and thrown away.

### Fixed — branches that could not be reached

- **Eight topics paid hearts for being asked a second time.** Ten results either listed a condition
  twice (doubling its weight) or paired `+1000` with `-1000` on their own cooldown memory (cancelling
  it), which sank the repeat branch below the branching-disabled fallback. MCA picks the last result
  when everything scores zero or less, so re-asking dropped into the legacy path: the first-time line
  again, no session, and 2–4 hearts every time. Simulating all 28 topics at their cooldown now finds
  none that reward.
- **Five topics had no repeat branch at all.** `us.happy`, `us.future`, `family.checkin_child`,
  `family.ask_parent` and `season` are gated by a cooldown that nothing was written to catch. Each
  now has the "you already asked me" beat its twenty siblings have.

### Changed — content that read as the same line twice

- **The five deep topics shipped one refusal between them.** `life`, `dreams`, `hopes`, `regrets` and
  `secret` all answered a guarded villager with *"Some things stay mine for now."* over the identical
  four buttons, even though the replies behind those buttons were already topic-specific. Each is now
  written to the reply that follows it — a half-built thing, a hope you jinx by naming, a stone put
  down on purpose. The three young-villager screens (`life`, `dreams`, `hopes`) were cloned the same
  way and are likewise distinct.
- **69 second variants were rewordings of the first.** Reviving the dead base lines in 1.2.0 made both
  halves of every overlay pool visible for the first time, which exposed the pairs whose second line
  restated the first in different words — concentrated in `gloomy`, `greedy`, `peppy`, `sensitive` and
  `odd`. Rewritten as separate beats.
- **A crit read exactly like a success.** `day.lighten` shared its best-outcome line with its ordinary
  one, so the check system's top result was indistinguishable from a pass.
- **Villagers describing themselves as the wrong gender.** The `flirty` overlay called itself "a girl"
  five times and the player a "Handsome nuisance"; the base pack reported the player as "she" and
  spoke of "the man doing his job" in three places; the Portuguese carried "o homem" and "uma moça" in
  the same lines. Overlays apply to villagers and players of any gender.
- **House style is now consistent across both locales**: em dash throughout (82 bare hyphens
  replaced), ASCII ellipsis throughout (134 unicode ones replaced), and one missing comma.

### Changed — Brazilian Portuguese

`pt_br` is re-synchronised with every line above: 141 strings retranslated, the five new repeat pools
authored, and the gendered self-references fixed independently of the English. Key sets and
placeholder signatures remain identical across locales in all 23 namespaces.

### Added — five lints for the classes above

`ContentLintTest` now fails the build on: a line naming an argument its call site does not pass; a
declared template var no variant reads; a result that sets the speech slot twice; a condition listed
twice; and a condition both boosted and sunk. `LangKeys.linesOf` gives them one shared rule for
"every line MCA can actually draw for this key".

## [1.2.0] - unreleased

### Fixed — one line, two different sentences

- **A villager's reply no longer differs between the dialogue screen and the chat log.** MCA picks
  which `/N` variant of a pooled line to speak on the *client*, at random, once per `Component`
  instance — and it renders every interaction-screen line from three separate instances: the chat
  copy and the text-to-speech copy are each re-parsed out of the packet's JSON, while the panel keeps
  the original. Three parses, three independent draws, so the screen could read *"Straight to the
  terms."* while chat read *"Whatever's fair."* for the same click, and a voice pack could speak a
  third line again. The message now serves back the components it was built with, so all three read
  the same sentence. (It also stopped MCA's profession branch, which flips a coin per resolution,
  from putting the two surfaces in different *pools* rather than merely different variants.)
- **3,518 authored sentences that could never be shown are back in rotation.** MCA's pool builder
  indexes only the `/N` keys and always draws from them once any exist, so a plain base sentence left
  beside a `/1` is dead content — MCA's own lang has no such key anywhere, and ours had 3,518 of them.
  Every pooled family has been renumbered so its base line is simply its first variant. 1,678 of
  those families had exactly one live line where two were written, including 34 of the 38 pooled lines
  in *every* personality overlay: a crabby villager now has both of their answers instead of one. No
  sentence was edited, added or removed — the keys were renumbered around them.
- **The lint that was supposed to guarantee variety was counting a line nobody sees.** The pool floor
  added one for the plain base key, so a family with a floor of "three lines" was shipping two. It now
  counts only what MCA can draw, and a plain key beside a pool is a build failure rather than the
  house style. Coverage lints learned the same rule: a key exists if it is plain *or* pooled.
- **Two players standing together hear the same words.** A chat-mode reply is sent to the speaker and
  to every bystander in range as separate messages, and each client used to roll its own variant.
  The variant is now chosen once on the server and sent as a concrete key, read straight from the lang
  files inside the mod's own jar — so it works on a dedicated server, where `assets/` is never mounted,
  and there is no generated index that could drift. The index deliberately excludes the five pools that
  extend MCA's own (`dialogue.main` and friends), where we ship only half the lines, and never names a
  variant past the end of a villager's personality overlay, which would silently drop them to the
  generic voice.
- **The humanised reply delay no longer scales with the length of a lang key.** On a dedicated server
  the line cannot be resolved, so `getString()` returned the raw key and the "typing time" tracked its
  spelling. The delay now uses the chosen variant's real length, falling back to the corpus median
  when there is nothing to measure.

### Added — the ledger speaks (MCA: Reputation, optional)

The 1.1.0 bridge supplied normalized gossip candidates but nothing rendered them, and the standing
topic was designed but not authored. Both are real now; without MCA: Reputation installed, nothing
below exists and Conversations is unchanged.

- **External gossip is actually told.** The gossip logic merges two sources — the native village log
  and the incidents this villager knows about the listener's deeds — into one normalized shape, and
  the newest story wins deterministically, so the `conversations_gossip` condition and the say
  action can never disagree. External stories render through Conversations' own dialogue voices
  (`dialogue.mcareputation.gossip.*`, en_us and pt_br) with up to four arguments, and use the same
  once-per-teller `LongTermMemory` flag native gossip always has.
- **Duplicate quest gossip is suppressed.** With Reputation active, completing a quest no longer
  seeds the generic `QUEST` gossip event — Reputation's named quest incident is the canonical story,
  and one deed should not be told twice in two voices. Memories and state still apply either way.
- **The standing topic.** A Village-category question — *"What do people think of me around
  here?"* — reachable from the GUI and from chat. The answer branches on your actual standing
  (well-regarded, neutral, poorly regarded, or an unresolved matter this villager knows about) and
  speaks your tier; you can press for the deed people mention, and when something genuinely hangs
  over you, an amends path lets you apologise in public — recorded through
  `conversations_reputation_signal` as `mcareputation:public_apology`, once per decision, never
  resolving the original deed by itself. Taking the answer with grace or snapping at it matters;
  children and teens deflect; without Reputation the villager honestly shrugs. Catalogued, linted,
  chat-intent-covered, and localized in both languages.

### Added — every topic is a real conversation now

- **The last ten legacy starters are converted.** `us`, `family` and `feelings` were flat menus that
  paid up to +8 hearts for a single click and had no follow-up at all — a spouse could say *"I've
  been rehearsing how to say it for a week"* and the conversation simply ended. They are now
  branching trees, split into `happy`, `firstmet`, `future`, `worries`, `memories`, `checkin_child`,
  `ask_parent` and `feelings`, with an arc on `feelings`. The migration ledger in
  `ConversationGraphLintTest` is **empty**: no topic anywhere pays hearts for being asked.

### Fixed — things the trees promised and did not deliver

- **A secret is no longer told before you agree to hear it, and is actually told once you do.** The
  opener used to *be* the secret; agreeing to hear it replied *"here it is"* and then delivered
  nothing. The opener is now a pre-disclosure beat with no content in it, both answers that accept
  carry the payload, and **declining has its own ending** — you can offer to hear it another time or
  change the subject, and you are never asked to promise to keep a secret you were never told.
  Declining does not advance the arc or set the `secret.entrusted` milestone.
- **Asking a villager whether anyone else knows their secret is no longer treated as betrayal.**
  *"Shall I mention it to the others?"* read as asking permission and cost 3 hearts and 8 trust. The
  hostile button now says what it means — *"I've been thinking of letting it slip."* — and the
  question it was impersonating is a real, safe answer of its own.
- **Jokes and payoffs no longer name things that only happened in one version of the story.** *"Well,
  the cat clearly won."* answered a bad-day opener that mentioned a cat one time in three; the other
  two were a sticking door and a dropped egg. Same for the toddler weather branch, where playing
  along meant agreeing about sky sheep the child had not necessarily mentioned. Both are now written
  to what every variant shares, and `DATAPACK.md` carries the rule.
- **Children can no longer be asked to keep an adult's secret.** `regrets`, `secret`, `rumors` and
  `work_offer` declared themselves adult-only in the catalog and were gated only against toddlers
  and babies. New lint `catalogAgesMatchOpenerGating` walks inbound routes — so a topic gated by its
  category page is not asked for a redundant gate — and fails if a catalog age and the button that
  offers it ever disagree again.
- **Three buttons in `life` that read *"Thank you for telling me."* did three different things**, one
  of which paid a heart. New lint `answerLabelsAreUniqueWithinATopic` allows identical labels only
  where the consequence is identical, so reusing a bare exit line across topics stays legal — that is
  voice — while a disguised choice is not.
- **The villager no longer narrates your conversational stances back at you.** When chat mode had to
  ask which of two things you meant, it rendered them from the design vocabulary: *"Do you mean
  offering comfort, or hearing the rest?"* Those now read as fragments of what you would have said.

### Added — a promise you can actually break

- **Pledging to stand with someone and then not coming back is now a thing that happened.** Both
  durable commitments the system tracks — `fears.support` and `dreams.support` — could previously only
  ever be honoured; the arc lines rewarded turning up and there was no branch for the other case. Making
  the pledge now also stamps a dated memory, and when the villager next raises it and that stamp has
  lapsed, they say so. **No hearts are lost on a first lapse** — the cost is trust and tension — and
  `fears` gets a repair node where you can own it, offer to be there now, or decline to make excuses.
- **A crit now tells you something a success does not.** Pressing or comforting well enough to crit
  promised *"the rest of it, the true shape"* and then routed to a page reading *"So now you know"*,
  which contained nothing new. Both crits now reach an authored second layer of the fear — how long
  it has been carried, and what it costs — before the conversation continues. The tier system is
  visible in the text rather than only in the ledger.

### Fixed — tiers that contradicted themselves

- **Being told off no longer leads to a page thanking you for the trust.** *"I didn't hand you that
  so you could pat it on the head"* routed to a close node whose two substantive answers were
  *"Thank you for trusting me with that"* and *"That took something to say"*. Rebuffs now reach a
  rebuff-aware close — apologise, accept the boundary, or leave. New lint
  `rebuffTiersDoNotRouteToLandedCloseNodes` fails any rebuff that lands on a node granting trust or
  warmth.
- **Apologising for having pushed no longer hands back the button that caused the scar.** It routed
  to the guarded node, which offers *"Come on, you can tell me."* It now reaches a repair node with
  no boundary push on it at all, asserted by the path simulation.
- **Turning checks off is no longer invisible.** In the off-state `fears` question the checks-disabled
  fallback shared its lang key with the success tier, so both said the same sentence — and the key,
  by being spelled `.success`, also collected the relaxed two-line variant floor meant for check
  tiers. The fallbacks now have their own three-line pools, and
  `sayKeyPoolsMeetTheVariantFloor` derives the relaxed floor from the result's `conversations_check`
  condition rather than from how the key is spelled.
- **"I can't promise that, but I'm listening" is now remembered as itself.** Three of the four
  exclusive groups recorded a second member that no condition ever read, so the honest refusal read
  back exactly like never having had the conversation. Each group now branches on both members and on
  having taken neither, and the fourth — the one that was already right — had a latent 1-in-101
  chance of speaking the wrong line, which is fixed too. New lint `everyExclusiveMemberIsReadBack`.

### Added — ages, and the day after

- **Toddlers have their own voice in nine more topics.** `food`, `life`, `dreams`, `hopes`,
  `feelings`, `village` and `checkin` routed three-year-olds into replies written for a ten-year-old,
  so a toddler who said *"I'm little! I do puddles and snacks and naps"* could be answered with *"Go
  on, tell me properly"* and reply *"Right — nobody ever asks for the long version."* Each now has a
  real toddler node. `weather` and `season` had the opposite problem — their "young" nodes were
  reached by toddlers and nobody else and were already written that way — so those are renamed to
  match what they are.
- **Children can report the village news, in a child's words.** `news` declared `child` and `teen`
  and shipped no age content at all, so children delivered adult lines about deaths and divorces.
  There is now a child's telling of every event type, rendered through
  `conversations_gossip_say`'s `phrase_prefix` — a parameter with zero uses until now, and one the
  lint had no opinion about; `gossipTypeLinesExistForEveryPrefixInUse` now requires any prefix in use
  to cover every type it can be asked to tell. `noticed` went the other way and is adult-only:
  reading an adult's mood and naming it is an adult move.
- **The second day of an arc is a real conversation.** Eight arc-resume nodes were terminal — every
  answer went straight back to the category — so returning to a villager you had opened up with was
  thinner than meeting them for the first time. Each substantive answer now continues into a second
  tier and then into the topic's existing close, while brush-offs and exits still end where they did.

### Fixed — a topic nobody could reach, and three that had no wrong answer

- **The ordinary day was unreachable.** The catch-all branch for a villager in no particular mood
  doing no particular chore — much the commonest state in the game — was authored with
  `baseChance: 0` and nothing but negative sinks, so it could never score. MCA's zero-weight rule then
  handed the click to the *last* result, which is the branching-disabled legacy line. Most villagers,
  most of the time, were getting the 1.0.0 experience with branching switched on. New lint
  `everyResultCanActuallyBeChosen` fails any result MCA could never pick.
- **`work_offer`, `rumors` and `noticed` had no wrong button**: every answer had exactly one authored
  outcome for every villager in every state. Each now varies — validating a grieving villager lands
  differently on a crabby one than a sensitive one, challenging a rumour lands differently on someone
  who trades in them, and asking what the job pays is a different conversation with a greedy villager.
- **Their branching-off state is the old experience again, not a stub.** All three answered with one
  unconditional line, and `work_offer` never opened the quest screen even when a quest was waiting —
  contradicting the documented promise that all three toggles off is exactly the 0.6.0 experience.
- **The depth floor is measured on every normal adult branch**, not just the deepest one
  (`topicsMeetTheirDepthFloorOnEveryNormalAdultPath`). That is what let the eight arc paths above ship
  at one decision while their topics claimed to be Deep. Age branches, cooldowns, below-gate deflects
  and "there is no news" branches are excluded — those are meant to be short.
- **The path simulator covers every topic**, not two of twenty-seven
  (`TopicPathSimulationTest`, renamed from `PilotPathSimulationTest`). It walks each catalogued topic
  from its opener back to the category through the real progress store, checking that asking never
  pays, that every state resolves to exactly one result rather than a lottery, that the walk
  terminates, and that the total stays inside the topic's budget. It also refuses to pass vacuously:
  a topic whose opener does not reach a branching node is reported rather than skipped.

### Changed — the deep topics stop sounding like each other

- **`life`, `dreams`, `hopes`, `regrets` and `secret` no longer share their words.** Three entire
  sub-trees were byte-identical across all five, so the refusal to tell you a secret and the
  reluctance to discuss your hopes for the harvest were the same sentence — *"I could. I'm choosing
  not to. There's a difference."* Every guarded, again and close pool is now written to its own
  subject: `secret` refuses to be pried at, `hopes` is superstitious about jinxing it, `dreams` will
  not be shown a house with no roof on it, `regrets` will not lift a stone it put down on purpose.
  New lint `deepTopicsDoNotShareLines` — exits stay shared on purpose, because a reused parting line
  is voice, and the exemption keys off the answer being an exit rather than a word count.
- **The "nobody has ever done that for me" beat is rationed to six sites.** It fired at 25, one for
  essentially every kind act in the game, which collectively established that every villager had been
  ignored by everyone forever until the player arrived. The other nineteen now acknowledge kindness
  four other ways — practical (*"Tuesday, and bring the good axe"*), deflecting (*"Don't say it in
  front of the others"*), surprised-then-brisk (*"Huh. Right — where were we"*), and reciprocal
  (*"And you? You get to answer that too"*). `rewardBeatIsNotOverused` matches the beat rather than
  the word, so a line like *"Nobody's said 'settled' yet"* — a fact about the village — is not caught.
- **Two node shapes that did not exist before.** Every one of 140-odd nodes was
  `[warm, curious, hostile, leave]`, so after two topics the buttons were predictable by position.
  `life`, `work`, `village` and `people` now offer a fifth answer — a joke — and the five deep closes
  offer to trade rather than only to thank, which is also the reciprocal disclosure the trees never
  allowed even though `deflect.secret` explicitly invites it. `regrets` gains a two-answer beat in the
  middle of its tree, where the only moves are to stay with it or to give the room; at the heaviest
  moment in the topic a menu was the wrong shape.
- **`dreams` forks.** Encouraging someone and being honest with them now lead to two different
  closes rather than the same one.
- **Variant pools that were one line and its editor's pass** are rewritten to take different angles
  rather than different wordings — `regrets.again` had the same "stones" metaphor twice,
  `work.respond.challenge.polite` said "it's fine, not love" three ways, and the `greedy` and `odd`
  overlays each had a near-duplicate pair. `variantPoolsAreNotParaphrases` logs anything above 0.65
  similarity for a human to judge and fails above 0.80, where it is not a judgement call any more.
- **`labelsDoNotReferenceSingleVariantDetail`** locks in the earlier fix and carries a curated map of
  which props belong to which variant, so the next pool with differing detail is caught rather than
  discovered in play.

### Added — the systems that were built and never used

Six small engine changes, each of which existed to make content possible that had never been written.

- **`enableTopics` does something.** It had no effect whatsoever: the flag was read only through a
  feature key no shipped dialogue named. All 150 branching results across the 27 openers now sink on
  it, so turning it off falls every topic back to its legacy one-line result — what `CONFIG.md` has
  claimed since 0.6.0. Asserted by a simulation over every catalogued topic.
- **`enableQuests` switches the quest conditions off.** `questScore` never consulted it, so quest
  branches kept matching for players who had turned the integration off.
- **`conversations_disabled: "seasons"` and `"holidays"` can fire.** Both fell through
  `isFeatureEnabled`'s default and scored as permanently enabled, so season- and festival-aware
  content had no way to degrade.
- **`PROUD` is read by something.** The state a villager is left in by the player finishing a quest
  for it was written, given its own config window, and consulted by nothing — not even the check
  resolver, which knew the other four. It is worth +4, between gratitude and infatuation.
- **`conversations_session` is readable.** 114 results had been writing a `branch` into the session
  since 1.1.0 and its only reader was its own setter, so content duplicated the branch into node
  names instead. The five deep topics' "we were just here" nodes — identical but for one lang key
  each — are now **one** node that asks the session which topic is open.
- **`conversations_budget` exposes the daily ledger.** `positiveToday`, `negativeToday` and
  `repeatsToday` were tracked per villager and player and readable by nothing, so the cap clamped
  kindness to zero in silence. At the cap the villager now turns the offer down warmly.

### Added — content for the seams that had none

- **Villagers say something different at midnight.** `time_min`/`time_max` had zero uses and the
  `time_of_day` template variable zero references, so nobody in the mod spoke differently at dawn
  than at noon. Being about at a strange hour is now its own check-in branch, and asking what is
  keeping them up continues into the rough-day follow-up.
- **The disposition vector is finally audible.** `tension` had 105 writes and no reads, `familiarity`
  95 and none, and no gate anywhere used a `min` bound — so there was not one "you have earned this"
  threshold in the mod. Three now exist: a cooler reply while the air is still unsettled (the missing
  half of the apology mechanic), a warmer one from someone who has known you a long time, and an
  extra beat at high trust. All carry the `dispositions`-disabled sink the documentation described
  and no content had ever used.
- **Checks reach five more topics.** `conversations_check` lived entirely in `fears`, so eleven of
  fourteen stance families' tuned personality bias was computed by nothing at runtime. `regrets`,
  `work`, `village`, `people` and `day` each gain a checked stance. The `day` one converts a
  hand-rolled two-list personality gate into a real humour check — which is what finally makes the
  headline claim about a joke landing for a playful villager and falling flat on a gloomy one true
  rather than decorative.
- **Personality profiles cover what the content uses.** `curiosity` is required by 13 topics and was
  biased by 4 of 17 profiles; it is now on 15. `candor` goes from 3 to 11, and a resting `respect`
  baseline from 3 to 13 against content that writes the axis 91 times.
- **Replies read mood.** All 54 mood conditions were on openers; not one reply node read mood, which
  is the moment it matters most. Eight now do — including `passive` and `fine`, which nothing in the
  mod had ever branched on, so "they are just having an ordinary day" was unwritten.
- **Four MCA-native conditions that had zero uses.** A mayor now answers differently about the
  village than a peasant, an outlaw differently about the neighbours, a villager notices you are
  bleeding, and a village with a smith says so.
- **The world reaches beyond two answers.** All 36 world-condition uses sat in one file, so a farmer
  at harvest and a fisherman in a storm said identical things. `work`, `village`, `food`, `checkin`,
  `weather` and `season` are now world-aware, and the `clear` and `none` values — implemented,
  localized and never once authored — finally have lines.
- **The gift and quest layers reach ordinary conversation.** Gratitude names the gift, a smitten
  villager will talk about anything you like, and a villager you finished a quest for is almost too
  embarrassed to ask for another.
- **Quest gossip is tellable.** `GossipEventType.QUEST` was seeded, localized in both languages, and
  reachable only through `rumors`, so a village whose one untold event was a quest said "quiet week".

### Added — new content

- **The personalities speak past the first sentence.** Overlays covered 27 of 1,442
  `dialogue.conversations.*` keys and every one was a topic *opener*, so a villager said one line in
  their own voice and handed the next six exchanges to a single narrator. All 21 namespaces now also
  voice the first **reply** in six registers — accepting sympathy on a bad day, accepting an offer of
  help, being seen as a person rather than a pair of hands, being promised support, being given room
  to hope, and being asked again days later. Two lints hold it: every namespace must cover the set,
  and no two personalities may ship the same sentence for the same key.
- **You can ask about someone in particular.** `people` and `rumors` covered the neighbours in the
  abstract; there was no way to ask about a *person*, despite gossip having always templated real
  villager names. The new `neighbour` topic tells the same events as a considered opinion of somebody
  the villager has known for years — with its own voice, through `conversations_gossip_say`'s
  `phrase_prefix`. You can ask what they are really like, defend them, tell the villager it is not
  theirs to tell, or push for more and be turned down for it.
- **"I don't know what to say."** Every deep node forced warm, curious, cruel or leave, so honest
  inarticulacy — the most natural response to a confession — was unrepresentable in 593 labels.
  `life`, `regrets`, `fears` and `dreams` now let you say nothing useful and stay anyway, and are
  warmer for it than the composed answer would have been.
- **Blunt honesty is a stance.** `candor` was in the vocabulary, carried personality bias, and no
  topic required it. `noticed`, `people` and `work` now do: *"You're not fine and we both know it."*
- **Deferral and reciprocal disclosure**, the two other moves the trees never allowed: you can ask a
  villager to tell you when they are ready, and you can trade a story instead of only receiving one —
  which `deflect.secret` had been explicitly inviting (*"Secrets are traded, not given"*) with no way
  to accept.

### Known unbuilt

- **`flirtation` and `attraction` remain scaffolded and unwritten**, along with the three orientation
  traits. Both are in the stance and axis vocabularies, both carry interiority bias, and no content
  requires either. This is a deliberate scope decision rather than an oversight: the romance vertical
  needs a design pass of its own, and half-writing it would be worse than leaving it clearly empty.

### Fixed — documentation that had drifted from the code

- `README.md`, `CURSEFORGE.md` and the catalog's own comment all still said two pilot topics were
  converted; it is twenty-seven. The translated-string count is re-measured (4,724 per locale across
  23 namespaces), and the overlay claim no longer implies the personality voices reach the branching
  bodies — they cover the openers and deflections only.
- `DATAPACK.md`'s variant-floor bullet described a rule the lint does not enforce; it now matches
  `sayKeyPoolsMeetTheVariantFloor` exactly. Its `conversations_gossip` type list was missing `quest`.
- `CONFIG.md` claimed `enableTopics` deflects topic branches (it has no effect at all) and that
  `enableQuests` makes quest conditions score 0 (`questScore` never consults it). Both rows now say
  what the code does; both flags are wired up later in this release.

## [1.1.0] - unreleased

### Added — MCA: Reputation integration (optional)

**Villagers now take your public standing into account, and can tell each other what you have done —
when [MCA: Reputation](https://github.com/otectus/MCAReputation) is installed. Without it, nothing
about Conversations changes at all.**

That last clause is the important one and it is asserted by tests, not merely intended: with the mod
absent the standing term is exactly `0`, so every seeded check resolves to the tier it always did.

- **Public standing colours trust and respect checks.** `CheckInputs` gains a `publicStandingFit` term,
  read from the player's current tier and hard-clamped to ±8 on both sides of the bridge. The resolver's
  tier margin is 15, so standing can tip a borderline outcome and can never carry a check on its own.
  Warmth, attraction, tension, and familiarity receive nothing — those are private interpersonal state
  between one villager and one player, and what the village at large thinks has no business there.
  Reputation never writes a disposition axis and never grants hearts.
- **Two dialogue conditions**, `conversations_reputation` (score, tier range, title) and
  `conversations_reputation_incident` (type, status, tags, age, and whether *this speaker* actually
  knows about it). Both are registered **unconditionally**, because dialogue JSON naming an
  unregistered key is an error — a pack written for the full suite has to load on an MCA-only install,
  where they score `0` and your authored fallback branch fires.
- **One dialogue action**, `conversations_reputation_signal`. It names an *incident definition*, never a
  raw score delta: how much a public apology is worth is decided by the datapack, and the dedupe key —
  villager, player, decision id — makes a second click a no-op. Small talk, navigation, and asking the
  opener cannot reach it. Repeated clicking cannot farm standing.
- **The external gossip seam.** Reputation supplies incidents this villager knows as normalized
  candidates carrying a phrase key and up to four arguments; the "already told" flag stays exactly
  where it has always lived, in MCA's `LongTermMemory` under
  `mcaconversations.gossip.<eventUuid>.<playerUuid>`. Built-in gossip is untouched. (Rendering the
  candidates and merging the two sources landed in 1.2.0.)
- **Five template variables** for `conversations_say`: `reputation_tier`, `reputation_score`,
  `reputation_village`, `reputation_recent_deed`, `reputation_title`. Each has a neutral localized
  fallback in both `en_us` and `pt_br`, so a line using one never breaks and never reads as an error.

### Changed

- `gradle.properties` no longer hardcodes an absolute Linux JDK path, which made the build fail on any
  other machine. Set `JAVA_HOME` to a JDK 17 instead.

### Compatibility

- **MCA: Reputation is entirely optional**, gated by the same `ReputationBridge` discipline as
  `QuestsBridge`: no `mcareputation` import outside `compat/reputation`, the implementation reached by
  name after a `ModList` check, and every failure contained to one ERROR. A test walks the source tree
  and fails the build if either rule is broken.
- Existing dispositions, gossip data, progress, `LongTermMemory` flags, and quest memories are
  untouched. `mcaconversations_gossip.dat` loads unchanged.
- 450 automated tests pass, including all 432 that existed before this work, and both locales keep
  full parity.

### Earlier in 1.1.0



**Branching conversations, phase one.** Asking a villager a question no longer pays you for the
click. They answer; you choose what to say back; your reply is what moves hearts. Two topics are
converted in this release — **the day** and **fears** — chosen deliberately as the shallowest and
the deepest, to prove the grammar before the remaining twenty-six follow.

> ### Live verification has NOT been done for this release
>
> This release ships on unit tests, lint and a successful reobfuscated build. The production
> checklist — a real Forge instance with MCA, fresh and upgraded worlds, a dedicated server, two
> concurrent players, all three hub entry modes, relog and restart persistence, MCA: Quests and
> Serene Seasons present and absent, every config off-state, and deliberate farming and
> duplicate-packet attempts — **has not been run**. ForgeGradle's `runClient` is not a substitute,
> because MCA's own mixins misbehave in that runtime. Treat 1.1.0 as untested in play.

### Topics converted so far

| Topic | Depth | Branches |
|---|---|---|
| **The day** | quick | rough / good / ordinary, plus age-appropriate trees and a repair route |
| **Fears** | deep | checked stances, a three-stage arc, a revelation, a boundary scar and its repair |
| **Check-in** | quick | rough / good, from MCA's own greeting menu |
| **Food** | quick | a dietary-trait branch that is never the butt of a rewarded joke, plus ordinary taste talk |
| **Weather** | quick | a storm is concern; a fine morning is small talk. They are not the same conversation |
| **Season** | quick | the turning year, and the four festival days with a once-a-day invitation |
| **Work** | standard | the forty profession lines now *open* a conversation instead of ending one |
| **Work offer** | service | terms and motivation first; the quest screen opens only once you have said yes |
| **Village** | standard | resident pride, honest criticism, and having nowhere to call home |
| **The people** | standard | four personality-flavoured openings; pushing for gossip after discomfort costs |
| **Rumours** | standard | who told you, is it reliable, and who you will tell |
| **News** | standard | the event *type* picks the branch: a death and a wedding are not one conversation |
| **Noticed** | standard | grieving, annoyed at you, elated, or steady — four different answers |
| **Life story** | deep | a chapter they chose to reveal, and a later day that asks how it ended |
| **Dreams** | deep | promise to help, or say honestly that you can't — the two are exclusive |
| **Hopes** | deep | smaller than a dream; naming the first step is what makes it real |
| **Regrets** | deep | absolution and honest company are both valid, and mutually exclusive |
| **Secrets** | deep | a one-shot confidence, a promise you make or refuse, and a callback that proves it held |

The lint's migration ledger is now empty: no starter pays out on the click any more.

### The economy moved

- **Opener rewards are gone from the converted topics.** Asking "how's your day?" was worth +2 or
  +3 on the click; it is now worth nothing. What the day is worth is decided by what you say next,
  and the ceiling for a whole mundane conversation is +2.
- **Losses are real and cannot be refunded.** Brushing off someone's bad day costs a heart; doubling
  down when they object costs two more. Apologising afterwards settles the *tension* — the invisible
  relationship vector — and grants no hearts at all. You cannot pay your way out of having been
  dismissive.
- **Every conversation heart change is guarded.** In order: duplicate-transaction refusal → replay
  policy (full, then half, then nothing for the same decision the same day; milestone outcomes fire
  once ever) → per-conversation budget by depth class → per-villager per-player daily budget → MCA's
  own `rewardHearts`. Positive and negative budgets are separate, so antagonising a villager never
  creates room to earn more back.
- **No universally correct button.** A joke on a bad day lands for a playful or upbeat villager,
  falls flat on a gloomy, sensitive or anxious one, and is politely received by everyone else — no
  dice involved, just who they are. Same for unsolicited advice while they're working.

### Conversations that remember

- **A three-stage arc for fears**, advancing at most one stage per conversation and continuing on
  later days: they name it, you work out what would help, and later you ask how it went.
- **A one-shot revelation.** Getting someone to open all the way about what frightens them fires
  once, ever, and a later conversation says something different because of it.
- **A boundary that can be crossed.** Pressing after a refusal — not the first attempt, the one
  *after* being told no — sets a permanent scar. The topic opens warily from then on, the warm route
  closes, and an honest apology reopens a guarded one without erasing what happened.
- **A mutually exclusive promise.** Pledging to stand with them, or honestly saying you can't, are
  both remembered, are read back differently later, and the first one taken decides it for good.

### Chat mode reaches all of it

- 57 new context-scoped intents with 171 tested utterances, covering every substantive answer in
  both trees.
- **Numbered quick-replies:** a villager who has put a decision to you lists the choices, and `2`
  picks the second one. It is the same `selectAnswer` call the GUI button makes.
- **Live-decision filtering:** while a decision is open, matching scores the choices on the table
  plus the ways out. A weak global topic match can no longer masquerade as your answer; interrupting
  requires an explicit subject change that clears an absolute floor and beats the best contextual
  reading by a margin.

### New for datapacks

`conversations_session`, `conversations_affection_apply`, `conversations_progress_apply` and the
`conversations_progress` condition; a conversation catalog under `conversation_catalog/`; a
per-personality interiority registry under `interiority/`; and `stance` / `arc` fields on
`conversations_check`. Full reference in `DATAPACK.md`, including three MCA engine rules that were
never written down before and that decide how a result must be authored.

### Fixed / completed

- **`Dispositions.baseline` returned zero for every personality.** It now reads real resting values
  from the interiority registry, so a crabby villager genuinely starts colder than a friendly one.
- **Dialogue checks used a personality fit of zero and an arc stage of zero.** Both are real now: a
  check can name a stance family, and the villager's personality moves the outcome by less than one
  tier margin; a check can name an arc, so the seeded roll changes when the relationship does.
- **MCA's GUI submission path validates nothing** — no distance, open-screen, constraint or replay
  check, byte-identical in 7.6.20 and 7.7.0-beta.2. A narrow soft-failing mixin now rejects, *for
  this mod's questions only*, an answer that was never offered, a duplicate submission in the same
  tick, and any attempt to drive a villager that MCA says is mid-conversation with someone else.
- **The progress ledger is migrated field-by-field, never discarded.** Unlike the disposition store,
  a world opened once with a newer build and rolled back keeps its arcs, milestones and promises.

### Known gaps

- Ten answers across three areas still pay out on the click: `feelings`, and every spouse (`us`) and
  `family` starter — that is ten of the twenty-one topics the 0.6.0 hub actually shipped. The debt is
  tracked as a migration ledger inside `ConversationGraphLintTest`, which fails if a topic is
  converted without removing its row, or if a new rewarded starter appears without being listed.
- Interiority profiles carry resting baselines and stance bias only. Wants, boundaries and secret
  pools arrive with the topics that read them — storing state nothing reads is how save files rot.
- Converted results no longer populate MCA's analysis tooltip. That tooltip explains *lottery
  chances*, and a deterministic authored branch has none; fabricating one would be both misleading
  and a mechanics leak. The villager's words are the feedback.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-13

**MCA Reborn 7.7 support**, on top of everything 0.9.0 shipped. 0.9.0 does not start on MCA 7.7 at
all; this release fixes that and extends the personality system to 7.7's roster.

### MCA versions

Built and pinned against **MCA `7.7.0-beta.2+1.20.1`**, and verified to still start and run on
**7.6.20**. Every MCA signature this mod consumes is byte-identical across those builds; the one
real drift (`Personality` enum → registry-backed class) is handled without reflection.

**MCA 7.7.0-beta.1 is broken on its own** and this release does not change that: beta.1 ships a
truncated `forge-mca.refmap.json` (19 mixin classes vs beta.2's 31), so MCA's own `MixinLivingEntity`
cannot resolve `isImmobile()Z` in a production runtime and startup dies. Reproduced with MCA as the
only mod installed. Use beta.2 or newer.

### Fixed

- **0.9.0 could not start on MCA 7.7: `JsonSyntaxException: Unknown personality 'witty'`.** MCA 7.7
  renamed four personalities and turned a fifth into a trait, and its native `personality` dialogue
  condition parses values with `orElseThrow` inside `Dialogues.apply`, which has no error
  containment — so 11 conditions in the shipped datapack aborted the whole reload and the world
  would not load. All 49 uses of the native condition are replaced with a new parse-safe
  **`conversations_personality`**, which never throws and matches through the canonical roster, so
  one authored id works on both MCA versions.
- **Forge refused to load on MCA 7.7 without Architectury.** `mods.toml` declared Architectury
  **mandatory** while this mod has zero references to it. MCA 7.7 dropped the dependency, so anyone
  who removed it was blocked by *us*. The declaration is gone; MCA asks for whatever MCA needs.
- **`getPersonality` used `Personality.name()`**, which exists only on the 7.6 enum. It now reads
  `Personality.toString()` — the one accessor the 7.6 enum (`"ODD"`) and the 7.7 registry class
  (`"mca:odd"`) share — and normalises both to `odd`.

### Added

- **The four personalities new in MCA 7.7 — `playful`, `extroverted`, `anxious`, `peaceful` — now
  have written voices**, at 0.9.0's full 80-key shape (conversation lines *and* the 25 chat-mode
  lines). Upstream ships no overlay for any of them, so without this they would speak only the
  generic pool. Each is written to stay distinct from its nearest neighbour (playful vs peppy,
  extroverted vs upbeat, anxious vs introverted, peaceful vs relaxed).
- **`conversations_personality`** dialogue condition (string or array), parse-safe and alias-aware.
- **Client-only locale hook** (`MCAClientMixin`) for future locales: MCA gates per-personality
  dialogue to `en_us`/`ru_ru`, and this widens **only** the language check, only for locales that
  ship complete overlays, re-testing and preserving MCA's voice-pack and online-TTS restrictions.
  Declared in the mixin config's `client` section so a dedicated server never loads a client class.

### Added — Brazilian Portuguese (`pt_br`), complete

**2,453 strings**, covering every shipped key: the 41 UI/fallback/analysis strings, all 724 base
dialogue lines, and all 21 personality overlays — including the age voices (baby babble, toddler,
child, teen) and the full chat-mode vocabulary, so a Portuguese player gets natural-language chat
in Portuguese, not just menus.

Enforced by `LocaleParityTest`: identical key sets to `en_us`, identical placeholder signatures per
key, contiguous `/N` variant runs, no bare `%s`, and every locale declared complete in
`OverlayLocales` must actually ship every overlay. A missing or mistyped key fails the build rather
than rendering a raw translation key mid-conversation.

The `dialogue.chatmode.topic.*` labels are written as noun phrases that read correctly after a
preposition ("Pergunta sobre **o meu trabalho**"), because they are substituted into other lines
rather than shown on their own.

**MCA gates per-personality dialogue to `en_us`/`ru_ru`**, so the overlays would never have been
read. `MCAClientMixin` widens **only** the language check, and only for locales that ship complete
overlays, re-testing and preserving MCA's voice-pack and online-TTS restrictions verbatim. It is
declared in the mixin config's `client` section, so a dedicated server never loads a client class —
verified in the production run.

### Changed — personality migration

| MCA 7.6 | MCA 7.7 | Conversations |
|---|---|---|
| `witty` | `upbeat` | rewritten voice; `witty.dialogue.*` kept as a 7.6 alias |
| `shy` | `introverted` | rewritten voice; `shy.dialogue.*` kept as a 7.6 alias |
| `lazy` | `relaxed` | rewritten voice; `lazy.dialogue.*` kept as a 7.6 alias |
| `grumpy` | `crabby` | rewritten voice; `grumpy.dialogue.*` kept as a 7.6 alias |
| `athletic` | *(now the `mca:athletic` trait)* | kept as a **7.6-only** overlay, not offered as a 7.7 personality |

The four renamed voices were **rewritten, not copied**: Upbeat is genuinely positive rather than
Witty's dry deflection; Introverted is reserved and articulate rather than Shy's uniform stammer;
Relaxed is unhurried-but-competent rather than Lazy's incapability; Crabby is irritable with range —
weary, blunt, and noticeably softer with someone it likes — rather than Grumpy's flat hostility.
Legacy alias namespaces carry the same text under the old prefix, so a world does not change voice
when the server upgrades.

### Changed — hub entry

`replaceChatWithConversations` (boolean) is replaced by **`hubEntryMode`**:

| Mode | MCA's Chat answer | Conversations button |
|---|---|---|
| `ADDITIVE` *(new default)* | unchanged | visible |
| `REPLACE` *(the 0.2.0–0.9.x behaviour)* | opens the Conversations hub | hidden (no duplicate entry) |
| `HIDDEN` | unchanged | hidden |

Named `hubEntryMode` rather than `chatMode` to stay clearly distinct from 0.9.0's **chat mode**
(`enableChatMode`, talking to villagers in normal chat) — the two are unrelated and independent.

Additive mode needs **no mixin**: the button is a datapack answer merged into MCA's `main` question
through the merge MCA already performs for same-named questions. A narrow `Question.getValidAnswers`
injection hides that answer in the other two modes, since MCA filters answers by constraints only.

**MCA's own AI chat is untouched in every mode**, as it always was: it is driven by
`MixinServerPlayNetworkHandler.handleChat` and never routes through the dialogue system.

*Migration:* existing configs land on `ADDITIVE`, a superset of both old settings. Set
`hubEntryMode = "REPLACE"` to restore the old routing exactly, or `"HIDDEN"` for MCA-only menus.

### Repository note

0.9.0 shipped from a state that never reached git: `origin/feature/chat-mode` held the 0.8.0
chat-mode source, while the released 0.9.0 jar contained a further delta (10 code files and 37
resource files). That delta was recovered by decompiling the jar and diffing it against a build of
the branch, and is now in source — verified by rebuilding and decompiling again, which reproduces
0.9.0's classes exactly and packages byte-identical `assets/` and `data/`.

### Tests

319 tests, all passing (0.9.0's source baseline had 297). New: `PersonalitiesTest` (roster, alias
resolution, parse-safety), `HubEntryModeTest` (behaviour matrix + injected `main.json` shape). The
overlay lint now enforces the personality-prefix rule and cross-namespace collision-freedom, and
draws its roster from the shared `Personalities` table so content and code cannot disagree.

### Verified on a production Forge 1.20.1 dedicated server (not `runClient`)

| Build | MCA | Architectury | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.9.0 | 7.7.0-beta.2 | yes | **crash** — `Unknown personality 'witty'`, never starts |
| 1.0.0 | 7.7.0-beta.2 | no | **starts** |
| 1.0.0 | 7.6.20 | yes | **starts** |

Confirmed on 1.0.0: dialogue conditions/actions register, chat mode reports its configuration at
startup, the datapack reload completes with no warnings, and `MCAClientMixin` is never loaded
server-side.

### Known limitations

- Client-side behaviour (the rendered button, per-personality line selection) is verified by lint
  and by MCA's own resolution rules, not by an automated in-game client run — MCA does not load
  under a ForgeGradle dev runtime.
- MCA 7.7 is itself in beta; the pin will move as upstream stabilises.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-15

**Chat mode** — a second frontend to the whole dialogue engine, **on by default**: talk to villagers
by typing in the vanilla chat box (`Agnes, how's your day?`) and they answer in chat, in their own
voice, with the identical heart gates, cooldowns, dispositions, checks, and gossip as the GUI. No
AI/LLM — deterministic, datapack-driven matching (`chat_intents/`, see DATAPACK.md).

### Added
- **Free-text matching engine**: keyword/IDF + phrase scoring with typo tolerance, synonyms,
  negation awareness, and per-answer constraint gating; ~50 shipped intents over greeting,
  chit-chat, profession, village, events, personal, relationship, and stance follow-up content.
- **Natural targeting**: name address (`Agnes, …`) > conversation stickiness (multi-turn follow-ups
  without re-addressing) > look-at > nearest; ambient questions may draw multiple staggered
  responders (`chatModeMaxResponders`).
- **Conversation depth**: open sub-questions (fears/dreams/feelings/us/family) keep context, so
  "You could face it — I'd stand with you." lands as the stance it is.
- **Social layer**: greeting/farewell/"stop talking"/"never mind" controls, graduated in-character
  confusion with topic hints, insult rebukes (ANNOYED + tension, never censors), personality-voiced
  deflections with grumpy/peppy/friendly overlays.
- **Proximity greetings** (`chatModeGreetOnApproach` + `chatModeGreetChance`, default on / 0.35):
  villagers *may* greet you on radius entry with an actual hello (`chatmode.hail` pools; a cold
  brush-off if they dislike you) — a personality-weighted, per-day deterministic coin flip, once per
  villager per player per day, on a budget separate from the GUI's ask-how-you've-been cooldown.
- **Villager attention** (`chatModeTypingAttention` + `chatModeAttentionTicks`, default on / 30 s):
  open the chat box and nearby villagers stop and turn to you (a one-byte client→server ping — the
  mod's first and only client code/packet); a conversation partner stays put facing you until the
  timer lapses after the last exchange. Villagers in danger are never pinned; "bye"/"stop talking"
  release them immediately.
- **Bare-name calls**: `Nataliya?` (typo-tolerant) gets a "Yes?" acknowledgment — the villager turns
  and waits. "Hey <Name>!" greeting-prefixed vocatives address that villager.
- **Heart feedback** (`chatModeShowHeartChanges`, default on): subtle `(+2 ♥)` suffix, shown once
  per exchange, speaker-only.
- **Local chat** (`chatModeLocalChat`, default on, EXPERIMENTAL): opted-in players' chat is
  radius-local unsigned text (still logged to the server console); set false to restore global
  signed chat.
- `/conversations chat on|off|status` (everyone) and op tools `chat debug-ask` / `chat debug <msg>`
  (live scoring introspection).
- Config `[chat]` section (radii, thresholds, delays, mute, format, …; see CONFIG.md); per-player
  opt-in capability; `chat_intents` datapack format incl. third-party synonym packs.

### Fixed
- MCA's "Last interaction analysis" panel showed raw keys (e.g. `analysis.time_min`) for conditions
  MCA ships no label for — added labels for `time_min`/`time_max` ("Time of Day"), `is_pregnant`,
  `rank`, and all 12 `conversations_*` custom conditions.
- Quests integration compiles against MCA: Quests 0.9.x (`QuestDefinition.title` API change).
- In-world test findings: "Hey <Name>!" vocatives and bare typo'd names now resolve; "what are you
  doing / up to", "what's up", "what do you do (for a living)", and "how is everyone doing" now
  match their topics; the topic-hint sentence no longer leaks a raw `greet` key; multi-line answers
  no longer repeat the heart suffix per line; "stop talking" mutes only that villager (not the whole
  village); unmatched chatter near a sticky villager stays silent instead of drawing confused lines
  unless the message actually engages them (question form / second person).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-11

A small correctness fix: villagers now address the player by the name they chose in the MCA
character editor instead of their Minecraft username.

### Fixed
- **Villagers use the player's MCA name, not their username.** MCA resolves the spoken player name
  (`%1$s`) from the player's family-tree node, falling back to the account username when that node
  name is blank — which it was, because the chosen name is stored separately (the `villagerName`
  entity-data tag the MCA editor writes). On login we now copy that chosen name into the family-tree
  node (`McaCompat.syncPlayerFamilyName`, called from a new `PlayerLoggedInEvent` handler), so
  `getTranslatable` resolves it correctly for **every** villager line — this mod's dialogue *and*
  MCA's own. No-op for players who never set a name (their username still shows); the write persists
  via MCA's own `FamilyTreeNode.setName` and is overworld-global, so it holds across dimensions and
  relogs. Fixes player names in `conversations_say`, gossip lines, and quest-voice lines alike.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-11

The first **RPG-layer** release (1.0.0 track): villagers now carry an internal, per-player
**disposition vector** — Trust, Respect, Warmth, Attraction, Tension, Familiarity — and the deepest
stances resolve through **dialogue checks** with crit/success/partial/rebuff outcomes, piloted on the
fears topic. Hearts remain MCA's only visible relationship economy: the vector never shows as a
number and never grants hearts — it decides which replies open and how they land. Everything
degrades cleanly: all RPG toggles off is exactly the 0.6.0 experience.

### Added
- **Disposition vector.** Six bounded axes per (villager, player), persisted in versioned world data
  (`data/mcaconversations_dispositions.dat`), server-authoritative, pruned on villager death (and
  optionally by age). Axes decay toward a personality baseline with per-axis half-lives — Tension
  fades in ~2 days, Trust lingers ~7; Familiarity never decays. No per-tick processing: decay is
  computed lazily on read. Pre-0.7.0 worlds migrate implicitly (first read = baseline).
- **Farming guards on every vector write.** Per-axis per-day movement cap
  (`dispositionDailyAxisCap`), and repeating the same stance the same day yields full → half →
  quarter → nothing — for losses too, so Tension can't be rage-farmed. Authored deltas are capped at
  ±10 at parse time.
- **Dialogue checks with success tiers.** New `conversations_check` condition: four results per
  stance (crit/success/partial/rebuff) selected deterministically from the disposition axis, hearts
  (capped ±25 — checks refine MCA's economy, never fight it), MCA mood, conversation states, and a
  **seeded roll** (villager + player + check id + half-day time bucket, SplitMix64) — re-opening the
  screen can never re-roll a rebuff into a crit; coming back later legitimately can.
- **New dialogue vocabulary.** Conditions `conversations_disposition` (gate on a decayed axis range)
  and `conversations_check`; action `conversations_disposition_apply` (guarded vector deltas). All
  SafeParse-contained: malformed JSON degrades to never-match/no-op, never a crash.
- **Fears pilot content.** The fears follow-up now offers four stances: *comfort* (warmth check),
  *"You could face it. I'd stand with you."* (trust-gated challenge check), *"Tell me the rest of
  it."* (higher-trust press check), and the existing *share*. Below-gate stances get an in-character,
  **cost-free** guard reply (no rebuff-farming below threshold); rebuffs misfire in character, raise
  Tension, and always exit gracefully. 24 new base lines + 2 stance labels.
- **`[rpg]` config section** — `enableDispositions`, `enableChecks`, `enableCheckTiers`,
  gain/decay multipliers, daily axis cap, stale-days pruning, `debugRpg` logging. Each documented
  with its off-state fallback in CONFIG.md.
- **Age/romance structural gating.** The Attraction axis is layered shut for non-eligible targets
  (children/teens/married-to-someone-else): the read path, the write path, the check assembler, and
  the condition adapter each gate on a **fail-closed** eligibility read (any MCA API failure means
  not eligible).

### Validation
- New unit suites: disposition math (clamp/half-life/convergence), NBT round-trip + versioning
  (missing/future version → empty store, malformed entries skipped), farming guards, seed
  determinism/spread, resolver tier bands and disabled-state formulas, parser rejection paths.
- New content lints: parser-validated disposition/check args; every check id defines **all four
  tiers** with consistent axis/difficulty plus a checks-disabled fallback; tier results never
  dead-end; and `checkedAnswerStatesResolveToExactlyOneResult` — a full state-space simulation
  proving **exactly one result of a checked answer has positive weight in every reachable state**
  (MCA's result selection is weighted-random, verified from `Dialogues.selectAnswer` bytecode, so
  this is the invariant that makes checks deterministic).

### Notes
- MCA's dialogue-response packets are handled on the server main thread (verified from the Forge
  `NetworkHandlerImpl` bytecode: `enqueueWork`) — consequence application is single-threaded.
- Verified from the 7.6.20 jar: `EntityRelationship.isMarriedTo(UUID)` = partner match + married
  state, and MCA's mood names are exactly the seven the lint pins.

### In-world verification checklist (production instance — MCA does not load in the dev runtime)
1. Boot: log shows `conversations_disposition/conversations_check` and
   `conversations_disposition_apply` registered; world creation succeeds.
2. Fears page (25+ hearts, adult villager): all four stances + back render without clipping.
3. Below-gate: with a fresh villager, *challenge*/*press* give the guard reply, cost nothing,
   and stay on the fears page.
4. Re-open scumming: force a rebuff (`debugRpg` shows the tier), close and re-open the dialogue
   within the same half-day — identical tier every time; after a sleep/next half-day it may differ.
5. Farming: repeat *comfort* through the cooldown window across a day — `debugRpg` shows applied
   deltas diminishing full → half → quarter → 0 and the daily cap truncating.
6. Two players build **independent** vectors with the same villager (`debugRpg` read logs).
7. Relog + server restart: vector values persist (`data/mcaconversations_dispositions.dat`).
8. Pre-0.7.0 world: first conversation works, reads baselines, no errors.
9. Kill the villager: its disposition records are dropped from the saved data.
10. Toggles: `enableChecks=false` → stances give the single fallback line; `enableCheckTiers=false`
    → only success/rebuff appear in the debug log; `enableDispositions=false` → guard stances never
    block and checks still resolve (hearts-only); all off → 0.6.0 behavior; `/forge tps` unchanged.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-07

The **seasons & deeper-gossip** release: villagers now speak to the time of year and festival days, notice
neighbours moving in and out of the village, and report every kind of news in their own personality's voice.
Two new personal/village topics round it out. Everything is additive — existing saves and datapacks are
unaffected, and every new system degrades cleanly when its feature is off or MCA state is unavailable.

### Added
- **Seasons & holidays.** New `conversations_season` (`{"is": "spring"|"summer"|"autumn"|"winter"}`) and
  `conversations_holiday` (`{"is": "spring_bloom"|"midsummer"|"harvest_festival"|"midwinter"|"none"}`)
  dialogue conditions, plus `season` and `holiday` template variables. Seasons come from **Serene Seasons**
  when it's installed and fall back to a calendar season derived from the world day otherwise; holidays are
  always calendar-based. Tunable under `[world]` (`enableSeasonLines`, `enableHolidayLines`,
  `seasonYearLengthDays`, default 96 to match Serene Seasons).
- **A "How's the season treating you?" topic** under Chit-Chat that remarks on the current festival if one
  is running, otherwise the season.
- **Arrival & departure gossip.** Villagers now notice neighbours **moving into** and **leaving** the
  village — two new `GossipEventType`s (`arrival`, `departure`) detected by diffing the village's full,
  load-independent residency set against a persisted snapshot. A death is never mistaken for a departure,
  a newborn never for an arrival, and a village's first sighting only seeds the set (no false flood).
  Toggles: `[gossip]` `detectArrival` / `detectDeparture`.
- **Gossip in every personality's voice.** All 13 personality overlays now flavour the six village-gossip
  lines (marriage, divorce, death, birth, arrival, departure) — the gloomy villager, the greedy one and the
  peppy one break the same news very differently — each with a variant. Base gossip pools raised to three
  variants apiece.
- **Two new topics.** A personal **"What are you hoping for?"** (opens at 25+ hearts and feeds the existing
  regrets/secrets confidence chain) and a village **"Any rumors going around?"** that surfaces the gossip
  pool from the Village menu.

### Notes
- Serene Seasons is a **soft, reflection-only** dependency: it is not on the compile classpath and is reached
  purely by reflection after a `ModList` check, so an MCA-only install loads and falls back to calendar
  seasons with zero Serene Seasons classes touched.
- Content/unit lints extended in lockstep: `ContentLintTest` pins the season/holiday conditions and their
  value vocabularies; `OverlayLintTest` now requires all 13 overlays to cover the six gossip keys. New tests
  cover the holiday calendar, the season-from-day math, the Serene Seasons bridge seam, the arrival/departure
  residency diff, and the gossip-type round-trip.
- As with prior releases, MCA + Quests don't load under the dev `runClient`, so the MCA-touching behaviour
  (season/weather reads, residency diffing, the new topics in the live UI) is verified by the build/lint/unit
  suite; in-world confirmation is done in a production instance.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-07

The **anti-repetition** release: every personality now sounds like itself across the topics you hit most,
and two new event-driven systems give villagers something fresh to react to. Existing saves and datapacks
are unaffected — all of it is additive and degrades cleanly when a feature is off or MCA state is unavailable.

### Added
- **Personality voices, everywhere that matters.** All 13 personality overlays now cover the **core-20
  highest-traffic topics** (greeting, check-in, day, work, village, neighbours, food, the personal openers,
  the deflects, gossip, and "are you happy with us"), each with **2–3 `/N` variants**. Previously overlays
  flavoured only 15 topics with a single line apiece, so most villagers said the identical base line and
  repeated it verbatim on a re-ask. Now a grumpy farmer and a peppy one answer the same question in
  genuinely different voices, and asking twice rarely returns the same words.
- **Conversation states (moods).** A gift, a completed quest, a punch, or a death/birth/marriage in the
  village now leaves a villager in a short-lived mood — `grateful`, `smitten`, `proud`, `annoyed`,
  `grieving`, or `elated` — written as an expiring `mcaconversations.state.<name>` memory. Dialogue gates
  on it with a plain MCA `memory` condition (no new datapack vocabulary); durations are tunable under the
  new `[states]` config group. Generalises the old single `grateful` state. Requires `enableStates`.
- **Weather-aware lines.** A new `conversations_weather` dialogue condition (`{"is": "clear"|"rain"|"storm"}`)
  and a `weather` template variable let villagers speak to the current sky. Gated by the new `[world]`
  config group (`enableWeatherLines`) and the `world` feature flag; storm outranks rain outranks clear.
- **Two built-in topics** surface the new systems in normal play: a **weather** starter under Chit-Chat
  (villagers remark on the current sky) and a **"How have you been, in yourself?"** starter under Events
  that reacts to a villager's current mood — condolences while `grieving`, shared joy while `elated`.

### Fixed
- **CONFIG.md** now documents the `features.enableQuests` toggle shipped in 0.4.0 (previously undocumented),
  alongside the new `[states]` / `[world]` groups.

### Notes
- Content lints extended in lockstep: `OverlayLintTest` now requires all 13 overlays to cover the core-20
  key set (with variant integrity), and `ContentLintTest` pins the `conversations_weather` condition, the
  `world` feature, and the weather value vocabulary. New unit tests cover the state enum/rules and the
  weather bucketing/query.
- Long-tail per-personality topic coverage, seasonal/holiday lines, and deeper gossip are planned for
  follow-up releases.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Optional MCA: Quests integration** (only active when the `mcaquests` mod is installed; Conversations
  still loads and works fully standalone). All Quests-touching code sits behind a new
  `compat.QuestsBridge` classloading gate — the exact sibling of the MCA gate — so an MCA-only install
  never loads a `mcaquests` class. Config toggle: `features.enableQuests` (and the
  `conversations_enabled: "quests"` dialogue feature flag).
  - **Conversational awareness.** Four new dialogue conditions — `conversations_quest_available`,
    `conversations_quest_active`, `conversations_quest_ready`, `conversations_quest_completed` (value
    `{ "scope": "this"|"any", "min": N }`) — let villagers react to your quest state. They score 0 when
    Quests is absent.
  - **Drive quests from conversation.** New `conversations_quest_open` action (`{ "mode": "menu" }` or
    `{ "mode": "accept", "quest": "ns:path" }`) plus an "Anything you need doing?" answer on the
    Profession page that opens the villager's Quests menu when they have an offer (and says so gracefully
    when they don't). The Quests mod's own button stays the primary quest UI.
  - **Quests ripple through the village.** Completing a quest writes a permanent
    `mcaconversations.quest.done.*` memory on the giver and seeds a new `QUEST` gossip event other villagers
    tell; failing one writes `mcaconversations.quest.failed.*`.
  - **Personality-voiced quest lines.** A resolver registered with Quests renders quest offer/accept/
    in-progress/ready/complete/failed lines in the villager's Conversations voice (base pool
    `dialogue.conversations.quest.*`; per-personality overlays can be added later — falls back to base, and to
    Quests' own static text when Conversations is off).
  - **Conversations-based quest content.** Registers a `mcaconversations:talk_about` objective (completes when the
    player has the matching Conversations conversation) and a `mcaconversations:unlock_topic` reward (writes a Real
    Talk unlock memory) into the Quests add-on API.
- New content lints pin the four quest condition keys, the `conversations_quest_open` action, the `quests`
  feature, and the `conversations_quest_*` object args; new unit tests cover `QuestsBridge`, the quest parsers,
  the quest memory ids, and the `QUEST` gossip round-trip.

### Notes
- MCA: Quests-side additions ship in that repo (generic add-on seams: `api.QuestDialogueHooks` /
  `QuestDialogueResolver`, `api.ExternalSignalObjective`, `QuestManager.notifyExternalObjective` /
  `eligibleOffers(player, villager)`). Conversations's optional dependency degrades gracefully against a Quests
  build that lacks them.
- Not yet verified in a production instance (MCA + Quests don't load under dev `runClient`); see the
  in-world checklist below.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **The hub is now a category menu.** Opening Conversations shows six category buttons — Chit-Chat
  (day, food), Profession (work), Village (village, people), Events (news), Personal (life,
  dreams, fears, feelings, regrets, secret), Relationships (us, family) — instead of the flat
  15-starter list. Each category is its own dialogue question (`conversations.cat.<id>`); starters
  moved into them **verbatim** (conditions, heart deltas, cooldown memory ids, follow-up routing
  all byte-identical — in-flight cooldowns in existing worlds are honored), with only their
  return hop retargeted to the category page. Every page has a "Something else." back answer;
  the hub keeps "Never mind." to exit.
- **Empty categories are hidden**: the Relationships button carries `constraints: "family"`
  (MCA's `family` includes the spouse), so strangers never see it. The other categories are
  never empty — their gating is result-level deflection, exactly as before.
- Third-party answers merged into question `conversations` still work: they surface on the hub after
  the category buttons (uncategorized fallback). Packs can target `conversations.cat.<id>` to join a
  category. See DATAPACK.md's new "The category hub" section.

### Added
- Category lang keys: hub button labels (`dialogue.conversations.<id>`), page headers
  (`dialogue.conversations.cat.<id>`), and per-page back labels; starter button labels moved to
  `dialogue.conversations.cat.<id>.<starter>` with their old text.
- Three content lints: hub answers must stay side-effect-free navigation hops, every
  `conversations.*` question must be reachable from the hub, and answer label keys may not collide
  with question header keys (the pre-0.3.0 hub relied on exactly that double duty).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **Raw translation key shown as the hub header when entering via Chat**
  (`#Gmale.#EPEPPY.#TTEEN.dialogue.chat`): MCA's `next` action builds the header prompt from the
  raw next string, so the Chat→Conversations redirect displays key `dialogue.chat` — which no lang file
  provided (MCA never shows it; vanilla `chat` is an auto question). Added a `dialogue.chat`
  entry-prompt pool (5 variants) plus a personality-flavored entry line in all 13 overlays, and
  lint coverage so the key set can't regress.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **MCA's "Chat" button now opens the Conversations hub** (the separate "Conversations..." button is
  gone). Implemented as a soft-fail mixin on MCA's single dialogue routing point
  (`Dialogues.getQuestion`): only the exact `chat` hop is redirected; `chat.topic`/`chat.fail`,
  root/first-meeting, hire, rumors, and story flows are untouched (verified: MCA's `main.json` is
  the only referrer of `next: "chat"`). Config `replaceChatWithConversations` (default true); when off,
  Chat behaves vanilla and the hub is unreachable. MCA's old casual chat line pool is dropped.
- Work topic moved to a dedicated auto question (`conversations.work`) with per-profession responses.

### Added
- **Per-profession work talk for the whole runecraft modpack** (scanned 419 jars): hand-written
  lines for all 13 vanilla trades + nitwit + jobless, MCA's 6 registered professions
  (guard/archer/adventurer/mercenary/cultist/outlaw), all 8 More Villagers professions, Ars
  Nouveau's shady wizard, Chef's Delight chef+cook, Ice and Fire scribe, Vampirism's three, and
  Werewolves' expert — 37 professions × 2 variants. Unknown/future professions get a
  self-personalizing generic line via the new `profession_name` template variable (localized
  client-side).
- **New topics**: food (with trait-flavored replies — vegetarian, lactose intolerance, coeliac,
  diabetes, and a sirben easter egg), neighbors/people (personality-bucketed opinions), and
  secret (tier 3, unlocked by having confided — the payoff for the `confided` flag).
- **Age-appropriate answers**: child and teen villagers answer day/dreams/fears in their own
  voice (and never trigger adult follow-ups or unlock flags).
- **Personality overlays for all 13 personalities** (was 2): athletic, confident, friendly,
  witty, shy, sensitive, greedy, odd, lazy, grumpy, peppy join gloomy and flirty — 14
  high-traffic lines each.
- **Anti-repetition depth**: every say line now has a pool of ≥3 variants (≥2 for
  profession/trait/age precision lines); deflect and hub-prompt pools deepened.
- Lint gates: pinned profession roster + ResourceLocation wellformedness, trait vocabulary,
  dead-lang-key detection, variant-pool floor, overlay coverage floor, mixin-config guard.

### Removed
- `dialogue.main.conversations` button and our `chat.success/20-25` pool extensions (dead after the
  Chat replacement).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **World-creation crash** (`No enum constant forge.net.mca.entity.ai.Chore.CHOPPING`): the day
  topic used invalid `current_chore` values (`chopping`/`harvesting`/`fishing`); MCA's `Chore` enum
  is `NONE, PROSPECT, HARVEST, CHOP, HUNT, FISH` and MCA parses these at datapack load with no
  error containment, so the bad values aborted the resource reload while creating a new world.
  Corrected to `chop`/`harvest`/`fish`.
- Hardened all `conversations_*` condition/action parsers: malformed JSON (in this mod or any datapack
  using our keys) now logs an ERROR and degrades to a no-op instead of crashing the reload the
  same way.
- Content lint now validates condition *values* (chore/mood/personality/age_group/rank/constraints
  vocabularies pinned from the MCA 7.6.26 jar), not just condition keys — the gap that let the
  crash ship.

### Added
- Conversations conversation hub merged into MCA's villager Talk menu (`main` question), with 8 topics
  across three trust tiers plus gossip, spouse, and family branches (10 dialogue JSON files).
- Per-player conversation memory built on MCA's LongTermMemory: first-time / asked-recently /
  revisit-later responses per topic, permanent topic flags, `opened_up`/`confided` unlock flags.
- Custom dialogue conditions registered with MCA: `conversations_enabled`, `conversations_disabled`,
  `conversations_gossip`.
- Custom dialogue actions registered with MCA: `conversations_record` (multi-memory writes),
  `conversations_say` (templated lines: villager/spouse/village names, last gift item, time of day),
  `conversations_gossip_say`.
- Village gossip subsystem: marriage/divorce/birth detection by periodic village scan
  (relationship-snapshot diffing), death detection by event; village-scoped, name-cached,
  per-listener once-only delivery; persisted in `mcaconversations_gossip.dat`.
- Gift gratitude: a server-side mixin on MCA's `BreedableRelationship.acceptGift` records accepted
  gifts to a player capability and a per-player `grateful` villager memory (1 day by default).
- `checkin` greeting answer merged into MCA's `greet` question (memory-aware, once per half day).
- ~40 new `/N` line variants appended to MCA's most-heard dialogue pools (`main`, `greet.success`,
  `greet.fail`, `chat.success`, `story.success`, `shake_hand.success`).
- Personality-flavored overrides for gloomy and flirty villagers.
- `/conversations gossip list|clear` admin command (permission level 2).
- Config toggles per feature plus gossip/gift tunables (see CONFIG.md).
- Content lint test suite: dialogue JSON vocabulary, memory-id namespacing, lang-key coverage,
  variant-sequence integrity.

### In-world verification checklist (production-style instance)
1. Boot log shows `Registered dialogue conditions conversations_enabled/...` and no `Dialogue ... not
   properly formatted` warnings.
2. Villager Talk menu shows "Conversations..." and MCA's own buttons still work.
3. Fears topic: deflects below 25 hearts; `.first` line at 25+; immediate re-ask gives `.again`;
   after `/time add 48000` and re-ask gives `.revisit`.
4. "Us"/"Family" buttons hidden for strangers, visible for spouse/family.
5. Give an accepted gift → within a day, spouse "Are you happy?" references the item by name.
6. Marry two villagers (`/mca` admin) → within ~30s a third villager's "Anything happen around
   here lately?" names the couple, exactly once per player, surviving relog.
7. Kill a villager → death gossip names them after the entity is gone.
8. Toggle each `[features]` config off → related lines degrade to fallbacks, no errors.
9. `/forge tps` stays clean near a large village with scanning enabled.
