Deeper, less repetitive villager conversations for **Minecraft Comes Alive: Reborn**.

Shared gameplay and content track the Forge 1.20.1 line at 1.8.0. The parity manifest for each release
lives in `tools/parity/`.

## Features (1.8.0)

- **A first meeting sounds like one.** A villager who has never met you says a plain hello rather
  than greeting you by name like an old friend; someone you have met says "hello again"; a regular,
  a friend, a confidant, a spouse, a relative and somebody you have fallen out with each get a
  greeting of their own, in their own personality's voice.
- **Friendship has to be lived.** How close a villager treats you now needs separate days of actually
  talking and the familiarity you have built, not just hearts — and being their parent, child or
  sibling finally counts as family. Worlds from before this version, and MCA worlds adding
  Conversations for the first time, keep the friendships they had.
- **Walking through the village is quieter.** Friends greet you more often than strangers, one
  greeting at a time, and a villager who says hello as you pass keeps walking unless you answer.
- **Nobody knows your name before you have met.** Strangers greet and see you off without it, a
  respected stranger gets courtesy and nothing presumed, and partners and family have greetings of
  their own — your child greets you as a parent, your parent as their grown child. Every personality
  voices all of these greetings in character.
- **Townstead villagers live their Townstead lives in conversation.** With Townstead installed, a
  *Life here* category of eight topics — how they are keeping, their day, their trade, the years,
  their people, their places, what the village is becoming, the calendar — answers to their real
  needs, shift, trade level, building, village spirit and calendar. Villagers at work or worn out put
  off long talks in chat, collapsed ones do not greet you, a gift only counts as having helped when it did,
  the village gossips about crises, promotions, birthdays and new buildings, and a reply can play a
  heart-neutral reaction (with Emotecraft). Without Townstead, none of it appears.

## Features (1.7.3)

- **Topics that belong to a kingdom.** With Ultima Kingdoms installed (it has no NeoForge 1.21.1
  build yet, so on this port the integration waits for it), a topic can be offered only to
  villagers of the right kingdom, judged by where they live or where they came from, and only while
  the player stands well enough with its faction. The restriction holds on every way into a
  conversation — the dialogue screen, a numbered reply, typed chat, the dynamic hub, a crafted packet —
  and a gate Ultima cannot answer hides what it guards.
- **Guild contacts.** A villager appointed to speak for a guild can explain what the guild does and
  put in a request for an introduction or for its commissions. Ultima decides; the villager relays
  its answer to you alone and never repeats where an introduction leads.

## Features (1.7.2)

- **Villagers remark on what they know you for.** With MCA: Reputation 0.6.0, a villager who has
  heard that you stood your ground, or that somebody got hurt, can say so — filtered through what
  *that villager* knows, and never mistaken for liking you.
- **An apology is paid for once.** A conversation deed is recorded against the decision and the exact
  grievance it answers, not against whoever you said it to, and a fuller apology supersedes a partial
  one instead of stacking on it.

## Features (1.7.1)

- **Villagers stay put and face you** for the whole of a discussion, including minutes of reading,
  and are handed straight back to their schedule when it ends.
- **Sixteen blocks to keep talking**, with a second's grace out to twenty-four; nothing can be *done*
  from out of range, and opening a conversation still takes MCA's ordinary reach.
- **An attack ends the conversation for good**, and the villager is free to flee; a guard still
  fights back unless the server asks otherwise.
- **Another player can take the villager over** cleanly: the first player's window closes saying so,
  and nothing from it can reach the new conversation. The choice channel is protocol 4, so update
  client and server together.

## Features (1.7.0)

- **The restrained card is now the one you get.** New installations default to
  `dialogueMenuStyle = MINIMAL` and `motionMode = REDUCED`: the same numbered menu and the same
  input, drawn as one flat panel with a hairline above the answers, a plain numeral, and a focus
  mark in the row's gutter that moves no text. The full card is unchanged and one setting away.
  Upgrading changes nothing — an existing `mcaconversations-client.toml` already states both keys,
  and a stored `RESPONSIVE` or `FULL` is read as a choice, not as an old default.
- **Reduced motion means reduced motion.** Under `REDUCED` the only animation left is a short fade
  when the menu genuinely opens and closes. Focus, selection, expanding a clipped answer and turning
  the page are immediate. The entrance belongs to the menu rather than to each question, so a pause
  between two turns of a conversation is the card waiting, not the card closing and reopening.
  As before, this governs Conversations' own effects; Townstead keeps its own screen, camera and
  typewriter.

- **The card can show its own working.** Two overlays open inside the response viewport without
  moving anything: `H` lists the lines this client actually received and the responses it sent, each
  with its real outcome, bounded and forgotten when you disconnect; `P` changes the menu style,
  motion, reveal, interface sounds and control hints in place, and says plainly when the legacy
  `numberedResponses = false` switch is overriding the style you configured. Neither can select a
  response, and neither claims Townstead's own screen.
- **An offered topic that cannot be opened says why.** Ask a villager about something their own menu
  was showing you and you get a sentence — they are working, you already talked about it today, they
  are not ready — instead of silence. The sentence is a description of a refusal that already
  happened, never permission: selecting a topic still goes through the server's ordinary gate, and
  nothing you have not been shown is ever mentioned.

## Features (1.1.0)

- **Your reply is what shapes the relationship (new)** — asking a villager how their day went used
  to hand you hearts for the click. It doesn't any more. Now they *answer*, and **you** choose what
  to say back, and that is what lands. Sit with someone's bad day and offer to take something off
  their hands, and you've earned something. Tell them everyone has bad days and then double down
  when they bristle, and you've lost it — and apologising settles the air without buying the hearts
  back, because a slight isn't undone by saying sorry. **All 28 catalogued topics are converted** —
  from the weather and what's for supper up through fears, regrets, secrets, and the spouse and
  family topics — and no topic pays hearts for being clicked any more.
- **Conversations that remember (new)** — tell a villager you'll stand with them and they hold you
  to it a week later, by name. Get them to crack all the way open about what frightens them and
  they answer differently ever after, because they know you remember. Press them after they've said
  no and that is permanent: the topic opens warily from then on, and the only way back is an honest
  apology that doesn't erase it.
- **The same conversation by typing (new)** — every one of those choices is reachable in chat, in
  your own words. When a villager puts a decision to you, the options come with it, numbered, so you
  can answer `2` if you'd rather pick than phrase. While you're mid-decision, an idle "how's the
  weather" can't be mistaken for your answer.

## Features (1.0.0)

- **Chat mode** — talk to villagers by just *typing*. `Hey Coralia! How's your day going?` in
  the vanilla chat box gets an answer in chat, in her voice, through the **same dialogue engine** as
  the GUI — identical heart gates, cooldowns, moods, dialogue checks, memories, and gossip. No
  AI/LLM: matching is deterministic, datapack-driven (keywords + phrases with typo tolerance,
  synonyms, negation awareness), and unit-tested. Address villagers by name, by looking at them, or
  just keep talking — your conversation partner stays "sticky" for follow-ups. Multi-turn depth
  works too: open up their fears, then answer *"You could face it — I'd stand with you."*
- **A living village** — villagers *may* greet you as you pass (a personality-weighted daily
  coin flip — the peppy farmer usually says hi, the introverted librarian rarely; villagers who dislike you
  brush you off instead). Open the chat box and nearby villagers stop and turn to you expectantly;
  your conversation partner stays put, facing you, until a while after the conversation lapses —
  and still flees danger. Say *"bye"* or *"stop talking"* and they respect it, per villager.
  Shout a question in the square and the villagers it applies to answer, staggered. Since a promise
  comes due, an unacknowledged rupture, an open thread or a change in the villager's own situation
  all take priority over a plain hello on the same approach roll (`InitiativePlanner`, wired through
  `GreetOnApproach`) — the villager says that one line instead of hello. Both a greeting and a
  planner initiative go through the same `InitiativeGate.decide`/`record`; only the budget weight
  differs, so raising it never spends the greeting's one daily chance: a greeting is weighed as a
  bark and spends nothing, while a planner initiative is weighed as a full initiative and spends the
  day's one allowance.
  Optional radius-local chat (**EXPERIMENTAL**, default off)
  keeps conversations neighborhood-scale.
- **A relationship deeper than hearts** — every villager quietly tracks how much they *trust*
  and *respect* you, how *warm* they feel around you, recent *tension*, and how long you've known
  each other. Hearts stay MCA's one visible number — the vector never shows and never grants
  hearts; it decides which replies open up and how they land. It drifts back toward the villager's
  personality baseline over days, is capped against farming, and is per-player.
- **Dialogue checks** — the deepest stances resolve like a CRPG check with four outcomes:
  a *crit* opens the villager further than asked, a *success* lands, a *partial* half-lands, a
  *rebuff* misfires in character (and always exits gracefully). Outcomes come from the relationship,
  hearts, mood, and a **seeded** roll — closing and re-opening the screen never re-rolls; coming
  back tomorrow might. Piloted on the fears topic: try *"You could face it. I'd stand with you."*
- **Chat, replaced** — MCA's own "Chat" button now opens the Conversations hub: how their day
  *actually* went, whether they like their work, food, the neighbors, their life story, dreams,
  fears, feelings, regrets, and secrets. (Reachable via `hubEntryMode`; see CONFIG.md.)
- **Category menu** — the hub opens on six clean categories (Chit-Chat, Profession, Village,
  Events, Personal, Relationships) instead of one long list; pick one to see its starters, with
  "Something else." to step back. Categories with nothing to offer are hidden — Relationships
  only appears for spouses and family.
- **Personalized per villager** — work talk is profession-aware (hand-written lines for all
  vanilla trades plus every profession mod in the pack: MCA, More Villagers, Ars Nouveau, Chef's
  Delight, Ice and Fire, Vampirism, Werewolves — and a self-personalizing generic line for any
  other mod's professions); food talk respects MCA traits (vegetarian, lactose intolerance, ...);
  children and teens answer in their own voice. **Every personality has a flavored overlay** — all 14 MCA
  rolls on 1.21.1, plus `athletic`, `confident` and `peppy` (dropped from MCA's roster but still
  possible on an upgraded save) and the four older spellings (`witty`/`shy`/`lazy`/`grumpy`) kept
  as aliases of their successors, so a villager keeps its voice across an MCA upgrade. 21 overlay
  namespaces in all. Each covers the
  high-traffic lines (greetings, check-ins, day/work/village, the topic openers, deflects, gossip and
  the personality-voiced chat-mode deflections), each with 2–3 variants — a crabby villager and a
  peppy one answer the same question in visibly different words. **New in 1.2.0:** the overlays reach
  the first *reply* as well as the opener, so accepting sympathy, accepting help, being promised
  support and being asked again days later all sound like the villager saying them — not like one
  narrator speaking for everyone after the first sentence

## Requirements

Minecraft 1.21.1 · NeoForge 21.1.234+ · Java 21 · requires **MCA Reborn** for NeoForge (the exact
build is `mca_version` in `gradle.properties`).

The MCA range is deliberately narrow (`mca_version_range` in `gradle.properties`). This mod mixes into MCA
internals, so every release it claims to support has to be tested against, not assumed. If you are
on a different 7.7.x build and want it supported, say so rather than editing the range yourself —
a mixin that silently stops applying looks like a missing feature, not a version mismatch.

> **This jar is for NeoForge only and will not load on Forge 1.20.1.** The 1.20.1 Forge line is a
> separate download (`mcaconversations-<version>.jar`); this one is
> `mcaconversations-neoforge-<version>+1.21.1.jar`. They are not interchangeable in either direction.

> **Back up your world before upgrading.** Conversations migrates its own player data
> automatically (see below), but MCA 7.7.36 also changes how it persists personalities and traits
> relative to older 7.7 builds, and that conversion is not ours to undo.

> **Architectury is not a dependency.** MCA's 1.21.1 NeoForge artifact dropped it entirely, and
> Conversations has never referenced it.

### Upgrading a 1.20.1 world

Your remembered gifts and your chat-mode choice were stored as Forge capabilities. NeoForge does
not read those, so the first time each player loads, Conversations imports them from the old
`ForgeCaps` block into the equivalent data attachment. It runs once per player, never overwrites
data you have already made on 1.21.1, and logs one line per player when it fires.

The three world-level files — `mcaconversations_dispositions.dat`, `mcaconversations_gossip.dat`
and `mcaconversations_progress.dat` — keep their names and their contents, so dispositions, gossip
and conversation progress carry over untouched.

MCA: Reputation integration is live on this loader again: this release compiles against the NeoForge
1.21.1 build of that mod's 0.6.0 compile-only API jar. Without MCA: Reputation installed, every
reputation-aware condition still scores zero and the reputation template variables fall back to their
existing text, exactly as they do on an install without the mod. Nothing else changes.

### Languages

**English (`en_us`)** and **Brazilian Portuguese (`pt_br`)** — both complete: UI strings, the full
base dialogue pool, every personality overlay, the age voices and the whole chat-mode vocabulary
(5,524 translated strings per locale, across 23 namespaces). MCA gates per-personality dialogue to
`en_us` alone; a narrow client-only hook widens that gate to the locales this mod ships complete
overlays for, while preserving MCA's voice-pack and online-TTS restrictions untouched.

Optional: **MCA: Quests** (quest-aware lines), **MCA: Reputation** (public standing, villagers
telling each other what you have done, and — from 0.6.0 — remarking on what *they* know you for),
**MCA: Capitals** (villages that are capitals speak
about their sovereign, heirs and court; court changes seed village gossip), **Serene Seasons**
(real seasons; calendar fallback otherwise), **Townstead** (needs, schedules, trades, life stages,
roots, buildings, village spirit and calendar become conversation state, with a *Life here* topic
category, reactions, gossip, and numbered choices in its RPG dialogue screen; **Emotecraft** is needed
for reactions to play) and **Ultima Kingdoms** (kingdom-gated topics
and guild contacts; inert on this port until Ultima Kingdoms ships for NeoForge 1.21.1) — all soft
dependencies; the mod works fully without them.

## How it works

MCA's dialogue system loads datapack JSON from any namespace and merges same-named questions, so
most of Conversations is data: `data/mcaconversations/dialogues/*.json` adds new questions and extends MCA's
`main`/`greet`. The Java side registers custom dialogue conditions/actions
(`conversations_gossip`, `conversations_disposition`, `conversations_check`, `conversations_say`, ...) into
MCA's public registries — no runtime patching of MCA except a set of small, narrowly scoped mixins,
all but one `require = 0` (`mcaconversations.mixins.json`'s `defaultRequire`), so a target that
stops matching a future MCA build is a startup warning, not a crash — the exception is the
1.20.1-save import (`PlayerLegacyDataMixin`), pinned to vanilla's own `Player#readAdditionalSaveData`
at `require = 1`. Eight apply to common code — the
Chat→hub redirect (`DialoguesMixin`), a gift observer for the gratitude state
(`BreedableRelationshipMixin`), chat mode's dialogue-payload-to-chat redirect (`NetworkHandlerMixin`),
a GUI submission guard (`InteractionDialogueMessageMixin`), the hub/age answer-list filter
(`QuestionMixin`), a guard on MCA's tokenless interaction-close request so a player who does not own a
managed discussion cannot end it (`McaInteractionCloseMixin`), a cancel of
`InteractTask#followPlayer` while a managed hold owns the villager (`InteractTaskMovementMixin`),
and the 1.20.1-save import (`PlayerLegacyDataMixin`) — and six to the client: a
digit-shortcut adapter for vanilla's own chat screen (`ChatScreenChoiceMixin`) and one for MCA's own
`InteractScreen` (`InteractScreenChoiceMixin`),
the personality-locale gate widener (`MCAClientMixin`), and three Townstead-cooperation mixins
(`TownsteadChoicePanelMixin`, `TownsteadRpgDialogueScreenMixin`, and
`TownsteadEmotionTagOverridesMixin`, which lets its typewriter find Conversations' emotion tags). Chat mode's matcher is a
second *frontend* to the same engine: free text resolves to the exact `(question, answer)` a GUI click
would send, so parity is structural, not re-implemented; its intents live in
`data/<any-namespace>/chat_intents/*.json` and are fully datapack-extensible (including synonym packs).

Client-side code is not limited to a typing ping: `client/` holds 42 files. The typing tracker
(`ChatTypingTracker`) is still the only one that reports anything back to the server — it edge-detects
the vanilla chat screen so nearby villagers can turn toward a typing player — but the rest render or
read local state: `client/dialogue` (32 files) builds the three configurable dialogue styles
(`RESPONSIVE`, `MINIMAL`, `MCA_ORIGINAL` — `McaConversationsConfig.DialogueMenuStyle`), with portrait
rendering, paging, digit-key shortcuts, transition-only narrator output and a per-character text
reveal; `client/dialogue/dev` (3 files) is a dev-only in-game preview screen and command for the
dialogue card; `client/townstead` (3 files) let Townstead's own choice panel accept the same
numbered-digit shortcuts through a reflective adapter, without linking Townstead's classes in, and
index Conversations' emotion-tag sidecar for Townstead's typewriter.

The relationship vector lives in its own versioned world save data and
**never touches hearts**: MCA's hearts remain the only authoritative, visible relationship number,
and every heart change still flows through MCA's own dialogue actions. See
[DATAPACK.md](DATAPACK.md) for the full JSON vocabulary (datapack authors can build on it, including
their own checked stances) and [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for configuration.

## Status

Alpha. Pure logic (gossip log, diffing, templates, content lint, the player-data migration) is
unit-tested, and the suite now runs with real Minecraft classes on the classpath.

Unlike the 1.20.1 line, **`runClient` and `runServer` are valid tests of MCA integration**: MCA's
1.21.1 NeoForge jar uses official Mojang names, so it loads as a normal mod in a development
runtime. On 1.20.1 its mixins were SRG-named with no refmap and only resolved in a production
instance. The in-world acceptance checklist is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### What is verified

Every push runs the unit/lint suite and the real-jar MCA binding probes (`.github/workflows/build.yml`,
`test` job, both Ubuntu and Windows) plus `verifyGeneratedConversationContent` and
`verifyVoiceOverlays`, so an authoring source that was edited without regenerating its committed
output fails CI. A separate `dedicated-server-smoke` job boots a real dedicated server against the
resolved MCA jar, asserts a clean start, runs `/reload` and checks that the chat-intent, conversation-catalog
and interiority-profile loaders re-ran, that no client class reached the server, and that the mod
logged no error. The job also asserts that each of the eight common mixins attached (the five client
mixins are not asserted, since a dedicated server loads none), and that the workflow's list must be
kept in sync with `mcaconversations.mixins.json` by hand. None of this is
an in-game production check: those are still open and tracked per-finding in
`docs/RELEASE-1.6.3-LEDGER.md`.
