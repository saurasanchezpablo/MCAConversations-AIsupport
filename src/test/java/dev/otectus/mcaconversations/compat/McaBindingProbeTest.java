/**
 * Resolves {@link McaBinding#MANIFEST} against the real MCA jar — the standing replacement for the
 * compile-time dependency this mod used to have.
 *
 * <h2>What this buys</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because no class names an MCA type any more (see {@code NoMcaStaticLinkTest}), the compiler can
 * no longer tell anyone when MCA renames or removes something the mod needs; a typo in a manifest
 * method name would otherwise surface as a silently dead feature rather than a build error. This test
 * restores that safety net: it walks the whole manifest against the MCA build on the dev runtime and
 * fails if anything required is missing, so a member MCA dropped shows up in CI instead of in a
 * player's crash report.
 *
 * <p>Each MCA build is opened in its own {@link URLClassLoader} rather than read off the test
 * classpath, so the manifest is verified against real MCA without a single MCA class being linked
 * into the test JVM. That loader's parent is a {@link McaHidingClassLoader} over the test
 * classloader, which is what makes the check meaningful in both directions: Minecraft and
 * Architectury types named in MCA's method signatures resolve to the very same classes the
 * manifest's parameter hints use — so a hint like {@code Village#getResidents(ServerLevel)}
 * genuinely discriminates between MCA's two same-arity overloads — while the pinned MCA the test
 * runtime carries for FML's sake stays invisible, so every probe resolves MCA from its own jar.
 *
 * <h2>Required vs optional</h2>
 *
 * <p>A miss in the <b>required</b> tier fails the build: the mod genuinely needs that member. A miss
 * in the <b>optional</b> tier is reported and allowed, because it is a member MCA removed and
 * {@code McaHandles} has a fallback for — no member is optional today, so any
 * miss is currently a build failure.
 *
 * <h2>Which MCA versions</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every build listed in {@code mca_probe_versions}, each opened in its own loader — one entry per
 * known package root. That fleet is the point: the root cannot be inferred from the version number
 * (7.7.0-beta.2 is {@code forge.net.mca}, 7.7.1-alpha.2 is {@code forge.net.conczin.mca}), so probing
 * only the dev-runtime build is how a root the binding does not recognise reaches players.
 *
 * <p>Skipped rather than failed when no MCA jar has been resolved, so the suite still runs in a
 * checkout that has not fetched them.
