/**
 * Resolves Minecraft Comes Alive: Reborn at <em>runtime</em>, by name, so one MCA: Conversations jar works
 * across MCA's package-root migrations instead of hard-linking one of them.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>MCA repackaged mid-line. Through 7.6.20 it shipped a Forgix-merged jar whose Forge classes live
 * at {@code forge.net.mca.*}; a later 7.7 build dropped the merge and renamed the base package to
 * {@code net.conczin.mca.*}. Because {@code McaCompat} used to {@code import forge.net.mca.*}, the
 * very first MCA reference on a renamed build threw
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError: forge/net/mca/entity/VillagerEntityMCA} — from an
 * {@code EntityInteract} handler, so a dedicated server died the instant any player right-clicked any
 * entity.
 *
 * <p><b>The root cannot be inferred from the version number</b>: 7.7.0-beta.2 still ships
 * {@code forge.net.mca} while later 7.7 builds do not. So this is a class probe, never a version
 * comparison. Class-relative names are identical across every layout seen, so the whole difference is
 * the one prefix in {@link #CANDIDATE_ROOTS}.
 *
 * <h2>The contract</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Resolution never throws and never returns null.</b> An unresolved member becomes a
 * <em>constant stub</em>: a {@link MethodHandle} of the identical erased type that returns the type's
 * default ({@code null}/{@code 0}/{@code false}/nothing). That is what makes per-member degradation
 * free — callers need no null checks, and a member MCA removed simply reads as "absent" rather than
 * exploding. Whole-class failures degrade the same way, via {@link Resolution#cls} returning null and
 * every dependent member falling back to a stub.
 *
 * <p>Members are declared in {@link #MANIFEST} as {@link Member} constants, which are the only keys
 * {@link McaHandles} uses — so the manifest is the single source of truth for what this mod needs
 * from MCA, and {@code McaBindingProbeTest} can replay it against any MCA jar in a throwaway
 * {@link ClassLoader} without loading a single MCA class into the test JVM.
 *
 * @see McaHandles for the resolved handles themselves
 */

     * internal slash form — that is what lets {@code NoMcaStaticLinkTest} byte-scan compiled classes
     * for slash-form MCA references and treat any hit as a regression.
     *
     * <p>One entry on 1.21.1: MCA ships a per-loader jar here rather than a Forgix-merged one, so the
     * {@code forge.} relocations the 1.20.1 line had to probe for do not exist and the renamed base
     * package is the only layout. The probe itself is kept whole — a future root is one array entry,
     * not a rewrite, which is the whole reason nothing below names a package literally.
